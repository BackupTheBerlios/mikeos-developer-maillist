<PRE>MITOSP: MIKEOS INFORMATION TRANSFER OVER SERIAL PORTS                version 1

MITOSP is the new TCP/IP.  But a hell of a lot slower.  One MikeOS computer is
connected to another router MikeOS computer. The router computer* is connected
to up to three other computers. Each computer has a number, like an IP address
but only a single byte long.


Let's call the first client computer 1. The second client computer is 2. 1 and
2 are connected to the router computer via serial port.  1 is plugged into the
router's COM1 port, and 2 is plugged into COM2.  The user at 2 (let's call him
Troy) wants to send JAKINBOX.BIN to the user at 1 (let's call him Mike.)  Troy
tells his computer to send JAKINBOX.BIN to 1.  2 reads JAKINBOX.BIN into an 8K
buffer.  2 tells the router to tell 1  to ask Mike if he approves of recieving
JAKINBOX.BIN from 2.

If Mike says yes,  1 tells the router  to tell 2  to send the first 2K  of the
buffer to the router.  The router waits for the 2K, and sends that off to 1. 1
adds the 2K it got from the router to the buffer, and requests more. If 2 says
that the next byte after 2K is null, it sends an EOF to 1. 1 then makes a file
called JAKINBOX.BIN  (or if that's taken, asks Mike for a name)  out of the 8K
buffer. Voila, Mike and Troy can share files!


Messages are just sooo much easier. Troy types his message, sends it to Mike**
and  2 does the rest.  2 sends the message  to the router,  who sends it to 1.
Mike gets  an os_dialog_box  with the  message.  Mike can then vice-versa  the
process  and send a message  back to Troy,  who will get a dialog  with Mike's
message. This could be adapted into a mail program.



*  the router computer  and all other computers  need to be running  a similar
   version of MikeOS.
** logically this would work best with login names.
