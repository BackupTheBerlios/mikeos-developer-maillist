That's an interesting point, and one which I don't know much about :-)
If you could convince the BIOS that yep, we're loaded in RAM now and
it doesn't matter how we got here, perhaps then you could activate the
real floppy drive. That would be excellent. I guess it all depends on
how stubborn the BIOS is in letting us make changes :-)

&gt;<i> (Before I get berated, I know it wouldn't be easy - I think I'd need more
</I>&gt;<i> research however!)
</I>
I don't think anything's really difficult - it's just all about time.
I wanted to avoid the FAT12 writing stuff as it's really laborious in
terms of testing, when I'd rather be coding cooler stuff :-) But that
had to be done.

Certainly any of us, with enough time and patience, could implement a
TCP/IP stack for MikeOS (and, making it black-box-ish enough, it'd
work on our other projects). But the vast amount of research, hacking
and testing involved would turn it into a one-year project, and as
mere humans we all like to see instant results :-)

&gt;<i> Also, booting off a FAT16 partition would be interesting. You would however
</I>&gt;<i> have to consider the MBR (to allow a boot) - so would that mean we would
</I>&gt;<i> need support for existing bootloaders  (to add 'MikeOS' as an option) or to
</I>&gt;<i> allow other OS's to use the same bootloader?
</I>
This is also an interesting point. GRUB can boot nigh-on any OS,
providing that the kernel has an appropriate header (ie string of
bytes identifying itself). However, GRUB automatically sets up
protected mode as I understand it, which'd be a nightmare to resolve
if we can't switch back easily.

However, with Ian's plans of hard drive booting, I'd love to chuck
away the current bootload.asm and have MikeOS booting by GRUB, as it'd
unify booting whether from the hard drive or floppy drive. That would
rock the Earth to its core.
