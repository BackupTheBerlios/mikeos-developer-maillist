<PRE>Yep - well getting grub to boot MikeOS isn't overly difficult - but it would
mean altering your build routine and bundling some grub modules (I'm sure
you've seen the tutorial on osdever.net!). You would still need an assembly
loader however!

It's interesting that MikeOS is BSD and I was rather banking on using
GPLv3... We'll see how that one pans out! :(

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm... When you are in floppy emulation mode, your OS boots and loads
</I>&gt;<i> itself
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into memory. You could therefore remove the ISO image/CD with no ill
</I>&gt;<i> effects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (as it's running like a Live system). Therefore, MikeOS knows it's in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory. Now, suppose we insert a floppy disk/image. That still sends an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interrupt as a result (as it would if you removed it). If we wrote in
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simple hardware detection to deal with those interrupts, it could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible to do it without an ISO9660 driver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's an interesting point, and one which I don't know much about :-)
</I>&gt;<i> If you could convince the BIOS that yep, we're loaded in RAM now and
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't matter how we got here, perhaps then you could activate the
</I>&gt;<i> real floppy drive. That would be excellent. I guess it all depends on
</I>&gt;<i> how stubborn the BIOS is in letting us make changes :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Before I get berated, I know it wouldn't be easy - I think I'd need more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; research however!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think anything's really difficult - it's just all about time.
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to avoid the FAT12 writing stuff as it's really laborious in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of testing, when I'd rather be coding cooler stuff :-) But that
</I>&gt;<i> had to be done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly any of us, with enough time and patience, could implement a
</I>&gt;<i> TCP/IP stack for MikeOS (and, making it black-box-ish enough, it'd
</I>&gt;<i> work on our other projects). But the vast amount of research, hacking
</I>&gt;<i> and testing involved would turn it into a one-year project, and as
</I>&gt;<i> mere humans we all like to see instant results :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, booting off a FAT16 partition would be interesting. You would
</I>&gt;<i> however
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to consider the MBR (to allow a boot) - so would that mean we would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need support for existing bootloaders  (to add 'MikeOS' as an option) or
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow other OS's to use the same bootloader?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is also an interesting point. GRUB can boot nigh-on any OS,
</I>&gt;<i> providing that the kernel has an appropriate header (ie string of
</I>&gt;<i> bytes identifying itself). However, GRUB automatically sets up
</I>&gt;<i> protected mode as I understand it, which'd be a nightmare to resolve
</I>&gt;<i> if we can't switch back easily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, with Ian's plans of hard drive booting, I'd love to chuck
</I>&gt;<i> away the current bootload.asm and have MikeOS booting by GRUB, as it'd
</I>&gt;<i> unify booting whether from the hard drive or floppy drive. That would
</I>&gt;<i> rock the Earth to its core.
