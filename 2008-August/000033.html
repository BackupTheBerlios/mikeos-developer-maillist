<PRE>In terms of the ApolloOS GUI I'm nowhere (I'm still focussing on getting
some stable code - in the next few months...)

In terms of MikeOS, I did make a start on a mouse driver. I set up a few
routines to draw a cursor to a screen at a given pixel location, but as your
graphics don't continuously refresh (or at least don't seem to) then you
can't really map mouse movements (it is static - as you move your mouse a
value for the movement of the ball can be sent to the stack per processor
cycle, but if your graphics don't refresh then you can't draw a cursor to
the screen as you move the mouse!). As I didn't fancy rewriting all of
MikeOS's graphics (as I'll confess at this point that I simply don't
understand them!) I stopped there! It is also possible to get a right/left
click from a mouse by setting a 'status' (essentially, when you click on a
mouse, you send an interrupt which sends a value to the stack. When you
release the button that stops sending the interrupt, so you would set it
back to 0). Depending on how many processor cycles 1 remains at (or how
quickly 1 returns again) gives you the functionality of a
single/double-click - and even a click and drag (which would give rise to a
windowing interface, buttons, icons, etc.!)

As you can see, I did a heck of a lot of research, but I won't be building a
complete mouse driver for MikeOS (as it would involve rewriting most of
it!). However, as I'm writing ApolloOS as a 32-bit C equivalent of MikeOS
(in that it is structurally similar and uses similar routines and
algorithms, albeit in a different language) I have a clean slate with which
I can produce a desktop GUI - though it will be a while before that comes to
fruition. ApolloOS 0.1.0 (when I finally finish it) will be simply the most
stable OS I can build in the next few months - the following version will be
far more exciting as I'll be able to build upon the ground work I've been
trying to lay since February!

Also - those of you using the <A HREF="http://apolloopsys.sourceforge.net/">http://apolloopsys.sourceforge.net/</A> portal are
seeing outdated info. Head to <A HREF="http://apolloopsys.googlepages.com/">http://apolloopsys.googlepages.com/</A> instead
(it works via the 'website' link on my sourceforge summary page). I've
written a PHP redirect script but since SF.NET have changed everything to
'ssh' (which I know nothing about) I haven't been able to upload it. Any
help on that front would be wonderful!

Anyways, I hope that details my current progress - I'm determined to get a
raw MikeOS bootloader to see my kernel binary - if all else fails I will
revert to grub, but there's no reason it shouldn't work!).

&gt;<i> Lo Bob,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, a simple serial-based communication system shouldn't be hard
</I>&gt;<i> to implement. There's no form of threading in MikeOS, however, and
</I>&gt;<i> that does drain resources a bit when it comes to checking for
</I>&gt;<i> keypresses AND checking for bytes in the serial buffer at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now, in serial.asm for instance, the program fires off an rapid
</I>&gt;<i> loop to check for both instances. I might be able to mitigate this
</I>&gt;<i> with 'hlt' -- I'll have a look this evening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking forward to seeing your work. How far did you get with the GUI?
</I>&gt;<i> I think that's still out of the question for MikeOS right now, but
</I>&gt;<i> someone has submitted a complete mouse driver implementation, so it'd
</I>&gt;<i> be good to see other code. (When the developer is happy with the mouse
</I>&gt;<i> driver I'll post a test image here.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
