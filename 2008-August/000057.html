That would indeed be incredibly cool, but there's a major stumbling
block. Right now, when MikeOS is booting from a CD-ROM, it's using CD
floppy emulation mode. In other words (as you see in the MikeOS build
script), the floppy image is injected into the CD ISO.

So, when you boot the CD, the BIOS says &quot;Ah! This CD contains a floppy
disk image, which we'll use as a virtual floppy drive.&quot; So as far as
the PC's aware, the CD becomes the floppy disk drive (albeit
read-only).

Once MikeOS has booted from CD-ROM, anything you try to do with the
floppy disk is translated by the BIOS back to the CD-ROM. You can't
differentiate between the two - as far as MikeOS is aware, it's
booting from a floppy drive even though it's a CD-ROM.

Hope I've explained that OK. In order to have MikeOS (or any other OS)
access the CD and floppy separately, it'll need to run natively from
the CD drive - that is, with an ISO9660 driver. Then MikeOS will know
for sure that it's running from a CD (and not a CD in floppy emulation
mode), so you can access the floppy as a separate device.

I don't know how hard it would be to code a CD ISO9660 driver, but if
you're really determined I'm sure it's doable!
