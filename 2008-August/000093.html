<PRE>Hi everyone,

Some general thoughts here - skip to the end if you're too busy to read :-)

Right now there are two features being worked on for the next release
of MikeOS, as you know:

1) FAT 12 write support
2) Mouse support

But there's something else I'm looking into - memory handling.
Currently, MikeOS exists in a single 64K segment of RAM, and never
strays out of it. The upper 32K is devoted to the kernel (of which 8K
is scratch space). So programs are limited to 32K, and it's all
getting a bit tight.

What are the solutions? Unreal mode (aka flat real mode) dispenses the
20-bit addressing scheme and provides access to a full 4GB of RAM - at
least, in terms of data. For executable code (CS:IP) however, you're
still stuck with 20-bit addressing, segment hassles, and a 1MB code
limit.

So it wouldn't really make things any easier - we'd still have the
segmentation annoyances. (For those who've not looked into segments
yet, see the Real Mode bit of
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_register">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_register</A> - it's pretty messy
stuff.)

One solution may be to define three segments for MikeOS: the kernel,
external programs, and external program data; and engineer it in such
a way that the user doesn't really have to know much about
segmentation (ie after an os_load_file routine they manipulate the
data with ES:DI and that's that). I'm not sure how much we can make it
transparent, but it'd clearly make the OS more capable.

Of course, for this transition the current system call method will
have to go out of the window, and be replaced with an int XXh
alternative. That's a shame, but with an appropriate mikedev.inc we
can still, say, have

  os_print_string equ 01h

and then programmers can use:

  mov si, msgtext
  mov ax, os_print_string
  int 25h

and so forth.

The other issue is DOS compatibility. It's cool, and Peter Nemeth and
co have done some fantastic work, but it's still extremely limited and
can only run a tiny number of DOS apps (mostly games). I'm wondering
if it's better off to remove it, and incorporate it into a separate
project - eg the 'OS in 7 steps' guide I mentioned before. It'd
arguably make the MikeOS code a lot cleaner, and I'm not sure how much
anyone else wants to hack on that side of things.

So, SUMMARY: 1) The MikeOS design, in terms of memory, is very
limiting. Would switching to a three-segment model make it too
complex? And 2) Is the DOS code a killer feature, or an infrequently
updated complication that doesn't really make MikeOS DOS compatible?

Opinions and (realistic!) ideas muchly sought - thanks :-)

M
