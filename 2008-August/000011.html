<PRE>That code won't work because there's no 'puts' routine in MikeOS -- it
needs 'os_print_string' with the location of the zero-terminated
string in the SI register.

What sort of stuff do you want to do with the docs and the site? I'm
pretty happy with the stringent focus as they are, and don't want to
change anything unless it greatly expands on what we already have :-)
My ultimate goal is to keep everything simple and concise.

Same with the ports situation -- I'll definitely add a ports page when
we have stuff, but we need to have actual real ports (ie stuff that's
like MikeOS and works like an actual OS before putting anything up).
The bits you've been doing with the C64 are cool, but naturally it
needs to do a lot more than print a few messages before we can call it
an OS!

So yep, when you've got some solid improvements I'll definitely add
you to the project -- but like I say, I don't want to make any drastic
changes, as the whole project is a concise learning exercise! We want
stuff that's largely complete and educational at the same time.
Experimental stuff is great, but that's not what the goal is here:
it's teaching OS construction. Well, at least for now... Until the
goal is to take over the world :-)

Erk, bedtime here in the UK!
