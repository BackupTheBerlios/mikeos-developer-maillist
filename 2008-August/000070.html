<PRE>Ahh, but does the 1.44 MB image load into extended memory? If not it would have to work some freakishly weird way.

Hmm.. the only other options are to use a small hard drive image (NOOOO!). SysLinux requires a CD driver, as does the standard effort.

Hmm... When you are in floppy emulation mode, your OS boots and loads itself into memory. You could therefore remove the ISO image/CD with no ill effects (as it's running like a Live system). Therefore, MikeOS knows it's in memory. Now, suppose we insert a floppy disk/image. That still sends an interrupt as a result (as it would if you removed it). If we wrote in some simple hardware detection to deal with those interrupts, it could be possible to do it without an ISO9660 driver.

After all, even Windows for Workgroups could tell the difference between two floppy drivers when it was running off one of them - but they used the same driver... how could this be...? ;)

(Before I get berated, I know it wouldn't be easy - I think I'd need more research however!)


Also, booting off a FAT16 partition would be interesting. You would however have to consider the MBR (to allow a boot) - so would that mean we would need support for existing bootloaders  (to add 'MikeOS' as an option) or to allow other OS's to use the same bootloader?

  &gt;  what u could do (and i will be asap with apollo once i have a stable

  &gt;  files and app/os settings 2 floppy. it's easy 2 do in qemu &amp; wud make
  &gt;  it a usable desktop os.


  That would indeed be incredibly cool, but there's a major stumbling
  block. Right now, when MikeOS is booting from a CD-ROM, it's using CD
  floppy emulation mode. In other words (as you see in the MikeOS build
  script), the floppy image is injected into the CD ISO.

  So, when you boot the CD, the BIOS says &quot;Ah! This CD contains a floppy
  disk image, which we'll use as a virtual floppy drive.&quot; So as far as
  the PC's aware, the CD becomes the floppy disk drive (albeit
  read-only).

  Once MikeOS has booted from CD-ROM, anything you try to do with the
  floppy disk is translated by the BIOS back to the CD-ROM. You can't
  differentiate between the two - as far as MikeOS is aware, it's
  booting from a floppy drive even though it's a CD-ROM.

  Hope I've explained that OK. In order to have MikeOS (or any other OS)
  access the CD and floppy separately, it'll need to run natively from
  the CD drive - that is, with an ISO9660 driver. Then MikeOS will know
  for sure that it's running from a CD (and not a CD in floppy emulation
  mode), so you can access the floppy as a separate device.

  I don't know how hard it would be to code a CD ISO9660 driver, but if
  you're really determined I'm sure it's doable!
