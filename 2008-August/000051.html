<PRE>Hi everyone,

FAT12 file reading support is pretty stable now in MikeOS (and in the
projects some of you have been working on). Write support is a lot
more complicated, but it's nonetheless very useful. There's not much
assembly language example code out there, and the specs are often
compounded by descriptions of hard drives and FAT16/32 information.

So this evening I've done some research and kicked off some work on a
FAT12 file write system call. Here's a summary of how FAT12 works:

1. A floppy disk is split up into 512 byte sectors, the first of which
is the boot sector (eg bootload.asm in MikeOS)

2. The following nine sectors contain the FAT. This holds information
relating to the data clusters (aka sectors) on the floppy - ie whether
they're empty or used for data. There are then another nine sectors
which contain a backup of the FAT for reliability purposes.

3. After those, there are 14 sectors containing the root directory.
This is built up of 32-byte entries which describe filenames, file
attributes, timestamps and so forth.

4. After the root directory, the disk data clusters (sectors) begin.

Now, the FAT is an interesting beast. To keep things compact, each
entry in the FAT, which describes the content of each data sector on
the disk, is packed into 12 bits. Of course, in assembly we're used to
working with 8-bit and 16-bit values. But with 12 bits, it means that
three bytes (24 bits) hold two 12-bit FAT entries.

So, when you're manipulating the FAT, you have to grab two bytes, then
shift out or mask the four bits that you don't need. A bit messy!

When you want to write a file, you first have to (A) find an entry in
the FAT which points to a free data sector. (B) Update that FAT entry
(its weird 12 bits) to point to the sector you're going to use. (C)
Write the file content data at the corresponding sector. (D) Find a
free entry in the root directory sectors, tell it which FAT entry to
use, and then set up a filename. (All this is for a single 512-byte
file which fits into a single sector - for bigger files, you need to
find more free FAT entries.)

Here's my code so far:

<A HREF="http://mikeos.berlios.de/fat12/file.asm">http://mikeos.berlios.de/fat12/file.asm</A>

This loads the FAT into RAM and scans the FAT for a free sector entry.
As mentioned, because of the 12-bit situation, two sectors are
referred to in the FAT by three bytes. So sometimes you have a FAT
entry on an odd-byte boundary (3, 9, 15 etc.) and other times on an
even-byte boundary (6, 12, 18 etc.) Hence the ODD and EVEN markers in
the code.

After the code has located a free FAT entry, it prints out the details
and then goes on to search for a free root directory entry. My next
work is to update the FAT when it has found an entry - that is, change
the data in the copy of FAT in RAM, and write the whole lot back to
the FAT on the floppy. It will then need to do the same for the root
directory entries.

So it's coming along well - that source code above is from the
programs/ directory, ie you run FILE.BIN to try it out. My summary
above is pretty brief, but there's a great deal more information here
(which doesn't stray into FAT32 or hard drives):

<A HREF="http://www.it.lth.se/ssoa/Project1/FAT12Description.pdf">http://www.it.lth.se/ssoa/Project1/FAT12Description.pdf</A>

So that's just a quick update, and might be useful to those of you
considering FAT12 write support. It's complex, but still fairly
logical and can be approached in a step-by-step fashion. My next goal
is to write a single 512-byte file - it's just a single sector so
won't require a multiple-sector approach. Shouldn't be too hard. I'm
travelling a bit next week but I'll have access to email and will post
any updates from my Eee :-)

Mike
