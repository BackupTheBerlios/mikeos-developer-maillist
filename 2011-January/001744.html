<PRE>Hi,

I think you're drastically underestimating the amount of work involved
in porting drivers. MikeOS and KolibriOS are EXTREMELY different OSes
-- the latter is 32-bit protected mode for starters, and will have its
own driver model. Just because they're both in assembly, doesn't mean
it's easy to port. Many OS kernels are written in C, but drivers
aren't necessarily portable.

If it was that easy, we'd have all sorts of goodies from KolibriOS now
such as networking! There may be some specs and ideas you can grab
from the driver source, but only if you have a VERY good understanding
of the tech involved (I'd wager it's all VESA video modes).

As we're in real mode in MikeOS, why not just use the BIOS? Look:

  mov ax, 12h
  int 10h

There -- in two lines of code you're in 640x480x16 video mode (VGA).
You can also plot pixels using int 10h as per here:
<A HREF="http://www.ctyme.com/intr/int-10.htm">http://www.ctyme.com/intr/int-10.htm</A>

There, you have a basic video driver. That is seriously about 0.01% of
the work required to make a GUI though!

&gt;<i> I have tried but the GUI fails to start and the screen remains blank.
</I>
If you try something and it doesn't work, SHOW US THE CODE! There's a
reason sites like pastebin.com. We're not mind-readers -- we can't
just magically guess your problem with no information! We need to see
what you've done if there's any chance of fixing it.

But I'd definitely go the BIOS route. See mikeos-gui.tgz for an
example of switching to 640x480x2, and a pixel plotting routine that
uses video RAM directly rather than the BIOS. There's also a font
rendering subsystem in there, along with the first 1% of widgets.
(It's 99% uncomplete and still with many hundreds of lines of code, so
consider just how vast the job of writing a GUI is.)
