<PRE>Hi guys...

An idea for MikeOS &quot;app`&quot; developers.

You lot are gonna hate me for this... :o) 
 
MikeOS and its availbale memory... 
---------------------------------- 
 
Although MikeOS is centred around a 64 KiB Segment does not mean that it 
doesn`t have access to more memory than this one segment. 
 
There is another 96 KiB to play with in either read only mode or read/write 
mode. These are NOT the two standard ROMs that also total 96KiB, the Video ROM 
and BIOS ROM, but the Video RAM and Segment 0 too. It can be assumed no other 
memory is available when using MikeOS in Video Mode 3, CGA, CODE PAGE 437 the 
default Video ROM character set. 
 
Note:- That any other memory is assumed NOT to be available by definition 
because MOS does not SEE it. Although easily accessible via assembly. 
 
So the MAP now consists of:- 
 
Segment 0x0000. 
 
MikeOS Segment 0x2000 - see MikeOS documentation. 
 
Segment 0xB800 - the CGA text mode memory area. 
 
Let`s take the CGA memory area, 0xB800 first. 
 
This cotains 4 active Pages, 0 - 3. MikeOS uses only Page 0 and allowing Page 1 
as a 4KB buffer then there is 24 KiB of active memory to use as anything from 
executable code to data storage. 
 
The first 4000 Bytes, Page 0 of this area can also be &quot;poked/drawn&quot; onto 
directly and &quot;peeked/read&quot; from at any time. If you know what you are doing 
then careful manipulation of Page 1 is another available 4KB of memory making 
28 KiB of free usable memory. 
 
So the whole 32 KiB of CGA Video RAM is fully DMA read/write under careful 
coding. 
 
Now let`s take a look at Segment 0x0000. 
 
Allow 4 KiB for BIOS Interrupts and DATA needed by the system. 
 
This segment is allocated by MikeOS as the SS, (Stack Segment) and the SP, 
(stack Pointer), initialised at 0xFFFF. Once the machine has booted into MOS 
then this segment becomes redundant. Why NOT use it? 
 
Q: How? 
 
A: Firstly allow 4 KiB from location 0x0000:0x0000 for BIOS usage and from 
0x0000:0x1000 
load your programs or data into here right up to 0x0000:0xFFFF. 
 
Q: But that will corrupt the stack. 
 
A: Right! Here is a method for your MikeOS *.BIN proggies to stop that:- 
 
your_program_start: 
	cli				; Doing some jiggery pokery so shut off interrupts. 
	mov ax, b800h			; MikeOS standard CGA active page. 
	mov ss, ax			; Make SS at start of this address. 
	mov sp, 7fffh			; Set SP to top of CGA video RAM. 
	sti				; Enable interrupts again with new Stack memory. 
						; Now have 24 to 28 KiB of SP memory FOR FREE. 
	&lt;your proggy here&gt;		; 32KB worth of assembly code. 
; 
; This includes transferring any additional code/data to segment 0x0000:1000 
minimum. 
; A total of 60KiB to play with here PLUS the BIOS I/O addresses at your command 
too! 
; At finish of your MOS proggy... 
; 
	call 0h				; Restart MikeOS kernel 
; 
; The Stack Segment and Stack Pointer are reset on kernel restart. 
your_program_finish: 
 
Just starter ideas... :) 
 
I await your kicking... 

I`m thinking of crude multitasking using active page switching in text mode too.

I`ll get back to you all when I have cracked it in my head.
