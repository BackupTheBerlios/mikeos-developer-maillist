<PRE>&gt;<i> Have a look at source/features/basic.asm and the code beneath each
</I>&gt;<i> BASIC instruction. There are certainly some system calls in MikeOS
</I>&gt;<i> that wouldn't need to be retained. I'm not sure what you mean by
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;recoded in BASIC&quot; though -- right now we have an interpreter written
</I>&gt;<i> in assembly language. We can't just arbitrarily mix BASIC instructions
</I>&gt;<i> in with that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right, will do. What I meant was that, say, the interpreter only needs
functions x, y and z and function a is not needed to run BASIC. Then, say,
functions y and z rely on x, such that it is possible to build a simpler
interpreter that only depends on function x, and code z and y in it's
version of BASIC to then run the full scale BASIC which in turn could
emulate a. It makes sense in my head, and by the looks of things, that's
exactly where it's gonna stay :P


&gt;<i> How would FASM make binaries smaller? I can't see how that's possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, for a simple OS I'm not bothered about heavy use of macros, and
</I>&gt;<i> the OSDev point is moot I reckon -- I don't think we're missing any
</I>&gt;<i> developers because of the choice assembler.
</I>

Multi-pass -&gt; heavier code optimisations, this is so far as I understand,
but again, sure not a big one. As for the rest, I guess that really just
does come down to personal preference, with the big whopper being that FASM
is self-hosting, but I guess that's pretty irrelevant for this project.

So you have a BASIC program loaded into RAM, and then a BASIC
&gt;<i> interpreter that goes through the BASIC program? That sounds like
</I>&gt;<i> massive overkill. Besides, as it is such a system would fall back to
</I>&gt;<i> machine code and BIOS interrupts most of the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, no, that's not exactly what I meant. Rather, that from within BASIC we
can have access to BIOS ints (or interrupts in general) so that for both
elegance and readability, we can, for example create an entire CLI in 'pure'
BASIC, with the character printing interrupts and so on embedded in the
code, otherwise I fail to see how, exactly, we can claim an OS in basic if
you just call some or other function/command (label?) in basic like PRINT X
without actually having that do anything in BASIC as opposed to being picked
up by the tokeniser of the interpreter (or however you have written it,
multiple-if's and so on). IE, if you wanted to code a new call/function ABC
in BASIC, you could and still have the power of actually
outputting/triggering system events and so on. Perhaps that's a better
explanation.

... from here it's not hard to fork the project, rip out
&gt;<i> unneeded bits and make BASIC the centre of everything
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Although unclear, that's exactly what I am hopefully getting at :)


&gt;<i> Then we can go about adding new instructions and features to BASIC --
</I>&gt;<i> there's lots more I'd like to add but I don't have the time! If we had
</I>&gt;<i> a few of us working on it, we could really extend it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>.. I would hate MikeOS being abandoned for a fork of it, and would
feel guilty ..

Agreed.

Best,
Tslil
