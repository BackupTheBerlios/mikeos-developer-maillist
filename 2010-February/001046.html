<PRE>Hi all...

&gt;<i> On a more technical note, I have a few question type things:
</I>[relevant cut]

I sat and tought about this...

With hardware even 5 years old, an OS like the one you describe
would be breathtakingly quick. The interpreter need only be 1/4
as good as say the MS QBASIC.EXE and still have serious clout.

Because of the shear power of my 2.66GHz P IV tool I had in 2002(ish)
with all the necessary ports then what a good use to put it to.

I know there are emulators for old tools of yesteryear but a new
version that would satisfy the needs of the few who still want to
experiment with their hardware and software would be great.

The only big stumbling block I can see is time from each individual.

I would hate MikeOS being abandoned for a fork of it, and would
feel guilty, as it seems to be only me that uses Mike BASIC in anger.

LBNL, I have no idea what the take up would be but putting feelers
out on different MLs/Forums/Sites might be worth while.

I looked at the DLs today and the TestCard has 12, so if that is anything
to go by there are at least some who are interested in anything that is free.

I personally would be more interested in doing what I do at present in
getting the last dram out of the hardware in such a restricted environment;
if only to show Joe Public that you don`t need to tap into NASA to get jobs
done...

My 5 pennoth...
