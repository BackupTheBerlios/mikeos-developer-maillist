<PRE>Hi Paulo...

&gt;<i> I think you taking this the wrong way.
</I>
&gt;<i> The point I'm trying to make is that if you offer it as a kit of some sort
</I>&gt;<i> for kids to experiment with, the parts have to be available almost anywhere.
</I>
Have you ever dealt with 8 to 10 year olds?
They want anything they do, to be done &quot;yesterday&quot;.
I`ve dealt with very many.

Winding a coil to them is about as interesting as watching paint dry.
They associate it with winding wool for knitting.
They, (boys that is), enjoy soldering, (it`s dangerous[ish]), and use tools
that they have probably never touched before.

&gt;<i> Yes, getting hold of a cartridge might be easy in the UK but the same cannot
</I>&gt;<i> be said for other countries.
</I>
But ANY cartridges will do. Mono, stereo, old record player pickups, magnetic,
ceramic, crystal; you name it, it doesn`t matter. I`ll bet most junk shops
would have one somewhere kicking about, let alone reputable suppliers.

&gt;<i> Surely the whole idea about getting kids to experiment with scientific stuff
</I>&gt;<i> is to get them to build it from as much &quot;common&quot; stuff as possible.
</I>
You have to keep their &quot;attention span&quot; and that is very short; believe me.
Coil winding would bore them sh**less...

Apply MikeOS to what is below.

Apologies Mike for what is below...

                   The Criteria for the TestGear? Projects.
                   ----------------------------------------

  In 1998 my (then 7 year old) daughter's friend's brother was (is)
  interested in tinkering with simple electrical and electronic projects.
  When I asked him if he had any basic Test Gear to check and calibrate his
  projects he replied &quot;No none at all, but I have got my own ~Commodore
  AMIGA~&quot;. On inspection I found he had an old A500 with 1MB of memory,
  a Television set, an extra floppy drive and it was MISSING the mouse.
  I then asked him if he would like his AMIGA to become his Test Gear, his
  face showed much surprise and he said &quot;Yes Please&quot;, he was at that time
  8 years old.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This set the criteria for all of the projects as shown below:-
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  1) The projects MUST run on a standard A500 WITH an extra floppy drive.
     Some projects may NOT be calibrated for this machine however as all
     the developement work was/is done on an AMIGA A1200.
  2) The projects MUST be Operating System friendly.
  3) A 0.5MB memory expansion for the A500 is optional.
  4) The initial projects MUST NOT require a mouse to work, this is
     optional. The keyboard IS the required minimum.
  5) The OCS graphics modes MUST be the required minimum display modes.
  6) A Television Set MUST be the required minimum display medium.
  7) Workbench 1.3x MUST be the required minimum Operating System.
  8) The projects MUST work on both NTSC and PAL. This is so that everyone
     in the world can use the software without modification.
  9) The projects MUST be simple enough for a young child to build in a
     VERY SHORT period of time, possibly under supervision. This is so as
     to be able to keep the attention span of that young child.
 10) All of the required components MUST be available to the general public
     from any or a known source.
 11) The projects MUST be VERY cheap to build in relation to their
     commercial/professional cousins.
 12) All external power supplies required for any of the projects MUST be
     batteries. A young child should NOT have access to MAINS voltage
     facilities or power sockets.
 13) All Calibration Equipment MUST be batteries or cells also.
     A young child has NOT got access to Professional Calibration Equipment
     so therefore he/she has to start from somewhere.
 14) The projects MUST NOT require special printed circuit boards to be made.
 15) The projects MUST NOT require any special tools, the standard tools
     should always be sufficient.
 16) IF a special tool is required then a supplier MUST be available to
     purchase that tool.
 17) As a multimeter/multitester is virtually impossible on any computer
     this MUST be a purchased item.
 18) If MAINS IS required to power up a unit to be tested, then a MAINS
     ISOLATING transformer WILL be required and MUST be used. This MUST be
     under the supervision of an adult.
 19) Any books required SHOULD be available from your local library.
 20) NO special knowledge of electronics is needed or required to build
     any of the projects.
 21) Read the ~Warning~ file for SAFETY reasons.

============================================================================

Now see where I am coming from...
