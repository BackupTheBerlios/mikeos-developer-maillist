Very true.
I assume it would be mostly aimed at youngsters, in which case games and game programming
should feature quite heavily.
No better way to get  youngsters to learn than when they are having fun.

So with this in mind, I attach my first contribution to BasicOS.
It's not software but hardware related, an idea for a simple game pad.
There is nothing worse than trying to play a game using a normal keyboard and using
a standard joystick on MikeOS or BasicOS is impractical.

The idea being that a small plastic box and a couple of switches connected to a cheap  keyboard
is much easier to use as a game pad then a normal keyboard.
It has the added advantage that no extra coding is required as the new switches are simply in parallel
with the ones on the keyboard.

I would volunteer to make up a couple which Mike could then make available on the site, but the transport to the UK
would make them far too expensive.
The &quot;kit&quot; would consist of the normal keyboard and the game pad which can be disconnected from the normal keyboard
when not in use.

Mike, if you like the idea then perhaps you could get some one locally to make them up.

Paulo.

I don't mean that in negative way -- what I mean is, if we want people
to use our BASIC interpreter, we need to put it in a different OS than
an asm-focused teaching tool. If we make a MikeOS fork focused on
BASIC, a ZX Spectrum-like OS, we can do all the stuff we want with the
interpreter, and if that means people run it and send us BASIC
programs they've written, all the better!

If such a thing ever gets off the ground, then yes, it'll have its own
name and site and mailing lists. And if it was reasonably popular
enough, there'd be scope for a hackers list (like this one, for
developing the OS) and a BASIC list (for those writing BASIC
programs).

Right now we have a BASIC that's pretty limited but usable for writing
small games, file tools etc. Few people are going to try it because
it's tucked away in an asm-oriented OS learning project. Put into its
own OS and expanded, it has more chance for people to use it -- we
have a new project to work on, and it'd get better as people submitted
their BASIC programs too :-)
