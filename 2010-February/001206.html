<PRE>Hi everyone,

There've been lots of feature ideas and good discussions on this list
recently -- thanks! Back in MikeOS 2.0, I included a mouse driver and
other bits in an attempt to flesh MikeOS out into a 'fuller' OS, but
with 3.0 I pulled them out due to:

1) Simplicity. Right now we use the BIOS for pretty much all hardware.
Whereas in 2.0, with the mouse driver, we had some (comparatively)
complex code for dealing with the keyboard controller, parsing mouse
data packets etc. Suddenly there was much more code and more concepts
and documentation to deal with.

2) My lack of time and knowledge. It was fantastic that someone wrote
a mouse driver, but I didn't have the time nor knowledge to really
understand the workings of it. In a 'big' OS that's fine -- Linus
Torvalds won't know the workings of 90% of drivers in the kernel. But
as a pet project thing, I like to grok everything that's going on, so
I can document it correctly and answer questions.

Now, there was a great solution to all of this. Tomasz, who wrote the
mouse driver (and was a much more in-depth and better asm hacker than
me!) spun-off MikeOS into TomOS. We thought it'd be great to have
MikeOS as the simple, educational OS project that I can manage, and
TomOS as the next step -- with extra features, more experimental
stuff, without the need to explain everything in depth.

Ultimately, it looks like Tomasz hasn't updated TomOS in a while and
has been busy with other stuff. But the idea is still there. If anyone
(or a group of folks) wants to take MikeOS as a base and turn it into
a bigger, broader-scoped, more involving project, that'd be brilliant.
I'll join in and help where I can. Tomasz had a go on his own, but if
a bunch of people on this list wanted to seriously attempt a new
project to expand on MikeOS, it might go further.

In summary: There's only so much I want to (and can!) do with MikeOS,
but there's scope for a bigger, separate OS based on the code. I'll
help where I can. Nothing may come of this particular post, but I've
written it to point to in the future if this topic arises again :-)

Cheers,
Mike
