<PRE>Hi Bazza,

All valid points, however if MikeOS/BasicOS is to move forward new features will have to be added.
Surely extra maths functions is an important addition,  (sorry no pun intended), especially on an educational OS.

I like Tslil's idea of a math lib but as you say, memory is at a premium.
On the other hand one could always use the x87 which takes up less space but I've never ever seen a 8087 myself.
Mike does advertise the OS as requiring a 386 minimum and 80387's are much more common.

Mike would obviously make the final call (oooh another one) as which way to go, but that extra maths functions need to be added
I reckon is a must.

As regards USB 1.1 support, you don't need any int 21h if all you want to have is raw I/O as opposed to HID,  HDD class, etc.
The USB controller is &quot;hanging&quot; off the PCI bus so all one has to do is access the PCI configuration registers and retrieve the
bus number, device number, function number and PID/VID of the USB controller.
If you have a PCI BIOS which all modern PC's have then it's simple.

Once we have that we can do a simple USB enumeration (not necessarily to full USB specs as we are only doing raw I/O)
and get the base address of the USB end points.


Paulo.

Hi All...

&gt;<i> The x87 was only optional up to the 486.
</I>&gt;<i> From there on it's part of the main CPU.
</I>&gt;<i> But of course Intel had to make things complicated and the FPU 
</I>&gt;<i> does not use normal registers like the x86.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead it uses 8 x 80 bit linear &quot;addresses&quot;.
</I>
&gt;<i> You can still use the FPU on a 16 bit OS.
</I>&gt;<i> The x87 will write a 32 or 64 bit number to memory and you could use
</I>&gt;<i> the opcodes CWD (convert word to double word) and
</I>&gt;<i> CWDE (convert word to extended double word) to simplify things.
</I>
All good stuff except...

BEAWRE...

1) We have only (pseudo-)64KB of memory to play with.
2) There weren`t many - if any - 8088/8086 machines with an 8087.
3) If loaded libraries are used then there are only two segments
available - the &quot;user&quot; one at 2000:0 and the boot one at 0000:0
This already makes 128KB of available memory so MikeOS is in
danger of slipping into a serious OS tool instead of a learning tool.
4) If we want as a group the full base memory of 640 (+ 384) KB
then fine by me, but the OS is &quot;sold&quot; on the MikeOS site for its primary
restriction of 64KB, which is what attracted me to it in the first place.
5) As I have said before it already is not true 8088 16 bit code.
6) If 4) is valid then why not generate dedicated MikeOS interrupt vectors
like MS-DOSs INT 21 and on and have much more flexibility such as USB 1.1
support as a minimum...

Just my 5 pennoth...
