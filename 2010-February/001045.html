<PRE>&gt;<i> - What OS calls does BASIC /actually need/ and which can be recoded in
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;basic?
</I>
Have a look at source/features/basic.asm and the code beneath each
BASIC instruction. There are certainly some system calls in MikeOS
that wouldn't need to be retained. I'm not sure what you mean by
&quot;recoded in BASIC&quot; though -- right now we have an interpreter written
in assembly language. We can't just arbitrarily mix BASIC instructions
in with that.

&gt;<i> - I firmly suggest a move to fasm for a number of reasons (smaller
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;binaries, better macros, larger OSDev community ...)
</I>
How would FASM make binaries smaller? I can't see how that's possible.
Also, for a simple OS I'm not bothered about heavy use of macros, and
the OSDev point is moot I reckon -- I don't think we're missing any
developers because of the choice assembler.

&gt;<i> - Can we design an interface between BASIC and BIOS so that we can have
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;nearly everything be interpreted in BASIC, incl. char print etc
</I>
So you have a BASIC program loaded into RAM, and then a BASIC
interpreter that goes through the BASIC program? That sounds like
massive overkill. Besides, as it is such a system would fall back to
machine code and BIOS interrupts most of the time.

I don't think we need BASIC interpreting another BASIC, or a
self-modifying BASIC, or anything like that. Right now we have a very
small and modular OS with a BASIC interpreter that I wrote in bits of
spare time. From here it's not hard to fork the project, rip out
unneeded bits and make BASIC the centre of everything.

Then we can go about adding new instructions and features to BASIC --
there's lots more I'd like to add but I don't have the time! If we had
a few of us working on it, we could really extend it.
