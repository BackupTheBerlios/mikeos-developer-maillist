<PRE>Hi guys,

 &gt; 1) What format would the input be in ? (i.e how would one pass say 12.75)
&gt;<i> Hundreds in say AX, tens in BX, etc etc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) What format would the output be in ? Hundreds in AX, tens in BX, etc
</I>&gt;<i> etc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) How many decimal points would be sufficient ? (Bazza hinted at 3 --
</I>&gt;<i> seems enough)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is what my &quot;half-precidion&quot; floating point format addresses, all the
hard work is done behind the scenes and one can just interface with
mth_i_tofloat or mth_f_toint and so on and so forth (also float/int &lt;-&gt;
string). The idea is that the only things that will need to use a float are
neatly tucked away in the library, nothing else has to wossy about the
format of the storage.

I talk of floats, by the way, as fixed precision humbers as you suggest are
too cumbersome and require more bandwidth (er, memory?) to store equivalent
ranges. With floats, due to the space between the mins of the denormalised
and zero (I forget what it's called), we can alse have things like NaN and
+/- Inf. as well as -0. All of which are handy, but would require further
space in the abovementioned fixed point format.

As for (3) above, well as things stand, the floats can cover the entire
range of a word as well as various numbers well above and inbetween, to the
maximum accuracy of (generally) 2^-128 which is,er, 39 decimal places? But,
in general, to make use of far less is no problem at all. For those in the
know, it currently stands at a 1.5.1+10 format with a bias of -127.
(Basically, this makes use of exactly one word)

I think, wheather or not this is ever used in MikeOS, I'm going to forge
ahead anyway - it's certainly a valuable learning experience.
