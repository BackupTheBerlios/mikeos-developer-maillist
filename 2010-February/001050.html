<PRE>&gt;<i> Multi-pass -&gt; heavier code optimisations, this is so far as I understand
</I>
Multi-pass is just for dealing with forward references, as far as I'm
aware. Given how low-level we are here, and that the assembler is
merely directly converting instructions into bytes, there's no
possibility for the assembler to optimise (not without removing
instructions which could break everything!)

&gt;<i> code, otherwise I fail to see how, exactly, we can claim an OS in basic if
</I>&gt;<i> you just call some or other function/command (label?) in basic like PRINT X
</I>&gt;<i> without actually having that do anything in BASIC as opposed to being picked
</I>&gt;<i> up by the tokeniser of the interpreter (or however you have written it,
</I>&gt;<i> multiple-if's and so on).
</I>
Ah, I think I see where you're coming from now! I should've explained
it better: I'm not thinking of an OS with a tiny core and then
everything else written in BASIC (like those Java OSes) -- that would
be cool but take ages to implement.

I'm thinking of a MikeOS fork which ditches the current CLI, program
menu, various unneeded syscalls etc. and only presents a BASIC
interface to the user. It boots and you see

  NONAMEOS 1.0 - 32768 bytes free
  Enter HELP for commands

  &gt;

and then you LOAD &quot;FOO.BAS&quot;, RUN, EDIT (to start the full-screen
editor) etc. In other words, just like the old ZX Spectrum and
Commodore 64. Their interfaces and BASIC interpreters were all written
in assembler (indeed there are some Spectrum ROM disassemblies on the
net) but the user interacted purely in BASIC.

Hope that makes more sense! It's certainly doable with the code we
have now, although I reckon we'd want to expand BASIC a lot more
before releasing it to the world.
