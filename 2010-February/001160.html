Hi all,

Applications for microsecond resolution delays.

Consider the following code:

; cx populated with a value between 1 and 65535

mov dx, 80h         ; 2 clocks on 386   1 on pentium
push ax              ; 2 clocks on 386   1 on pentium

time_loop:
in al,dx               ; 13 clocks on 386   7 on pentium  (+ 1uS)
loop time_loop    ; 11 clocks on 386   6 on pentium   total for loop is 24 clocks on 386  and  13 on pentium

pop ax         ; 4 clocks on 386    1 on pentium
ret                ; 10 clocks on 386   3 on pentium

; total clocks are 42 for the 386 and 19 for the Pentium

Worked examples:

Assuming a 386 running at 33MHz  clock = 30nS
therefore for a required delay of 10uS (cx=10), the actual delay would be:

2 + 2 + 10(24) + 4 +10 = 258 X 30nS = 7.8uS + 10uS = 17.8uS  (error = +78%)

and for a required delay of 65535uS (cx=FFFFh), the actual delay would be:

2 + 2 + 65535(24) + 4 +10 = 1572858 X 30nS = 47700uS + 65535uS = 113235uS (error = +72.8%)

Now assume a Pentium running at 1GHZ  clock = 1nS
therefore for a required delay of 10uS, the actual delay would be:

1 + 1 + 10(13) + 1 + 3 = 136 X 1nS = 136nS + 10uS = 10.136uS  (error = +1.36%)

and for 65535uS,

1 + 1 + 65535(13) + 1 + 3 = 851961 X 1nS = 851.9uS + 65535uS = 66386.9uS  (error = +1.29%)

It can be seen that the error decreases as the processor speed (and type) increases and/or the value in CX increases.
Although the errors look dreadful for the 386 example, when applying this to delay output to say an external circuit,
there are very few applications were it would actually make much difference.
For example if one was &quot;driving&quot; an Analog to Digital converter chip which needed say a 500uS delay between each access,
an error of tens of a percent would hardly make a difference as the sample has already been taken by the chip.
However if one wanted to play out digitised audio, then the large errors would result in an awful output.
In this case it would be much better to use the horizontal scan rate of the VGA card which on screen 13h equates to 32uS per line
which in turn would allow one to accurately play out audio with a sample rate of 31.250 KHz.

Another example where precise timing would be required is to get the LPT port to generate a simple black and white test pattern on 
a standard PAL TV. See fig 1for the pattern and for the circuit diagram see fig 2.
In this case the timing delays would be made up using (out 378h, SomeData) which take roughly 1uS.
We could use the D0 line for the &quot;video&quot; and D1 for the syncs.

mov dx, 378h     ; LPT port address

do_horz_line:

mov al, 2    
out dx, al    ; start the horizontal sync
out dx, al
out dx, al
out dx, al
mov al, 0
out dx, al    ; end the sync (PAL syncs are 4.7uS but 5uS is good enough)

out dx, al    ; &quot;waste&quot; another 5uS on the porch.
out dx, al
out dx, al
out dx, al
out dx, al

; we are now left with aprox. 52uS for the video

; now do 10 X out dx, al for the first black section

mov al, 1

; now do 10 X out dx, al for the first white section

mov al, 0

; now do another 10 X out dx, al for the middle black section

mov al, 1

; again 10 X out dx, al for the next white section

mov al, 0

; now finish the line with 12 X out dx, al

jmp do_horz_line


That's it.
Once you've done 575 loops, do the horizontal sync and retrace
which I will leave to you. ;-)

For greater accuracy I have not used any loops when creating the actual video.
Bet you never thought that the LPT port could generate video.

Paulo.
