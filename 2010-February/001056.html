<PRE>&gt;<i> I assume it would be mostly aimed at youngsters, in which case games
</I>&gt;<i> and game programming should feature quite heavily.
</I>
Youngsters are definitely one target, yes -- they might not find it
themselves, but their parents might show them it in a &quot;I learnt my
trade on a good old Spectrum/C64, so I want my kid to get started on
something equally simple&quot; fashion.

I'd like to think some older programmers would be interested too --
more folks like Bazza. I'm certainly in that group. I love
programming, but I've really got no inclination to work on some big,
complex C++ app. There are enough browsers and office apps and music
players etc. in the world. I much prefer fiddling with more esoteric
stuff, like Game Boy programming. So we might get some old-school
hackers on board.

&gt;<i> So with this in mind, I attach my first contribution to BasicOS.
</I>
I think we have a name :-) Nobody else seems to have used BasicOS as
the name for a non-hypothetical OS project, and it works perfectly in
that it's (a) a simple OS and (b) built for BASIC. That said,
&quot;basicos&quot; is a very common word in Spanish so I don't know how we'll
fare in the Google rankings :-)

&gt;<i> It's not software but hardware related, an idea for a simple game pad.
</I>
It's a great idea, and complements the idea for the project well. You
could always sell the kits from SA! Or if this plan comes to fruition
and we clearly have some outside interest, you could make a couple,
put them on eBay and we'd link to them on the site.

OK, so this is my plan. (I work on computers all day and tend to get
spots of RSI so I don't like to do much in the evenings, so this'll
take a couple of weeks!) I will put together version 0.1 of BasicOS,
which will be a stripped down, refactored MikeOS with a BASIC-driven
interface, full-screen editor and sample programs.

That's the starting point. From there we think of what features we
need (and if they're possible), expand the BASIC interpreter with more
instructions and flexibility, and round out the OS into what we want
it to be. This'll take a few months. Then we release 1.0 and see how
it goes -- if nobody's interested then never mind, it was a learning
experience and we can roll back some of the BASIC changes into MikeOS!
If it gets a bit of recognition, hopefully we'll get some .BAS
programs submitted and can think about 2.0.

I won't have lots of time to work on this, so it'd be great to have as
much help as possible. For those who've not done much with assembly
language: this is going to be a simple OS, so it doesn't require asm
wizardry. Do a bit of learning and we'll have a team of people who can
hack up ideas and fix bugs etc.

Onwards and upwards!

M
