<PRE>Hi Mike,

You've hit the nail on the head.
Much to my dismay, I often get people at work from other departments wafting
in and look with utter awe/disbelief/fear at the stuff I'm typing away when programming.
The most common question is &quot;how the heck do you understand this stuff?&quot;

Sometimes (depending on my mood) I point them towards Liberty Basic, which is a nice
simple BASIC dialect for programming GUI apps on windows machines.
I've already had some come back to me and say that it's not so bad after all.

And this is exactly the point, to most people, programming computers is something from
another planet.
The complexities of modern os'es with all the libraries, dependencies, etc makes things even worse.

I believe BASIC is the answer and yes I suspect there would be a demand for a Spectrum-like OS
provided that loading the OS is simple.
It's no good making a nice simple OS and then complicate things by expecting a beginner to create
an image from a flp and having partcopy/nasm etc.
Yes these should be available but so should an ISO which they could burn directly to a CD/DVD, pop it in a computer
and they are ready to go.

Just by two cents worth.
Paulo.

Like Tslil, I'm just throwing some ideas around here...

Recently on Slashdot (or similar) I saw a story bemoaning the
complexity of computers thesedays and how hard they are for kids to
learn. Sure, there are fairly easy-to-grasp languages like Python, but
you can still get bogged down in the multiple levels of abstraction in
a modern OS, and the billions of libraries for these languages.

One poster remarked that he was going to dig out his old C64 for his
kid to start programming on, like he did. Some others expressed
similar feelings. Perhaps there's a demand for something here?
