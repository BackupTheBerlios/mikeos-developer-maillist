<PRE>I'm glad we've finally come to the 4.2 release.
It now has many more applications that we've all worked hard on.

@Blacklight Great work on the new shell, it's really great. Now I can
rename, delete and copy files without scrolling through a file list.
This is great when you have a lot of files (of project you may or may
not release).

@Mike Thanks for including my applications. Why not MB++ (APPDEV)?
Is it because it complex and difficult to read? I'm sorry about that
but I had size limits. I would fill it with comment lines and format
it a bit better if I have a bit more memory (hint:segments) but this
would make it 2-3 times bigger and we don't have that much program
space. Can you include calculator? Or is that missed because it's
based on MB++. I have several programs I'm working on.

&gt;<i>We could do with a new TEST.PCX for the VIEWER program.
</I>Hey, what about create pictures in ASCII Artist ;-)

&gt;<i>I'd like to get the first three really stable.
</I>&gt;<i>I just don't want to make regular 4.2.x releases
</I>&gt;<i>unless absolutely necessary!
</I>You mean like a long term version in which I keep it back and
test extensively for bugs? :-O
I have been moving to do less but bigger releases recently, that
might help.

</PRE>
