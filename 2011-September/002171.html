<PRE>&gt;<i>Apparently that's already possible. I should have read the handbook more carefully.
</I>Don't work it took me ages to figure that out to.

&gt;<i>It might not be too late to squeeze
</I>&gt;<i>Pacman into 4.2, if you're happy with it. I plan to have a two-week
</I>&gt;<i>testing period for 4.2
</I>That should be enough time.

&gt;<i>just sos you know, in draw.bas the &quot;rem colour subroutine&quot; is spelled wrong
</I>Thanks for the heads up, but there are a probably a lot of these in my
programs, I don't exactly use the world's best spelling and grammar in
my comment lines :-\ , there are probably a lot more.

&gt;<i>Joshua is using $a, $b etc, which will be overflowing that allocated space.
</I>It was a really bad idea from the start, the problem was, it worked.
I learn that using some such as $a or $d (case sensitive) would cause
trouble, so I avoided them. I actually don't use that many text variables
and 1-9 would probably suffice in most cases.
However it would take an extensive amount of rewriting to almost all my
programs and it would break all MB++ programs when updating to the latest
version (like Calculator and Pacman) as the function inputs would be
different and I take pride in never breaking compatibility.

In saying that, it will a 64k RAM limit using an extra 3.5k that is usually not
needed may not be sure a good thing because it would reduce the usable memory,
even if it was in the &quot;secret&quot; unused area between the kernel and the
disk cache.

If I have to make a call on this one (call 65515?) I'd say do, you don't have to
do all possible characters, just to case insensitive letters. Most of the time
I don't use the full 128 characters anyway, that doesn't even fit on one line.
The most one could use would be 71 characters when using EDIT.BIN on MikeOS.
I'd never use more than 36 (maximum box text length), so maybe you
could make them
say, half size or less to conserve RAM and keep numbers the full length.
