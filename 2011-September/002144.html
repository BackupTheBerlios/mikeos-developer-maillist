</I>Thanks Mike! I think I could throw a few more explanatory comments in 
there (for example, explaining my (ab)use of the stack) because there 
seem to be a few bare patches.

&gt;<i> 2) I'd like to simplify the text editor so that instead of Rename we
</I>&gt;<i> have Save As. So you hit F2 to save with the current name, and F3 to
</I>&gt;<i> save with a different. Put New in F4. You can add space for the Save
</I>&gt;<i> As help in the bottom info bar by putting &quot;Press Esc to quit&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i> top bar.
</I>Will do, makes sense to me.

&gt;<i> 3) Let's make the default new filename &quot;UNTITLED.TXT&quot; rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;UNTITLED&quot;. MikeOS requires that filenames have three-letter
</I>&gt;<i> extensions -- when it's &quot;UNTITLED&quot; it doesn't save correctly (I'll
</I>&gt;<i> update the error messages to show that)
</I>That's easy enough. There's a db down at the bottom called untitled_txt 
that, conveniently enough, contains &quot;UNTITLED&quot;. And was originally 
planned to end with &quot;.TXT&quot;, but for the life of me I can't remember why 
I omitted that.

&gt;<i> 4) When you use &quot;del&quot;, it shows the filename in the resulting text:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Deleted FOO.BIN&quot;. That's cool -- can we do the same for &quot;copy&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ren&quot; etc.? Eg &quot;Copied BLAH.FOO to LOLWUT.BAR&quot; as the output text?
</I>Easy enough. Will do.

&gt;<i> 5) There are a couple of things in the code that could be clearer.
</I>&gt;<i> Line 27 of your cli.asm has this comment: &quot;The final prompt is
</I>&gt;<i> returned in AX&quot;, but that makes no sense to me there (presumably it's
</I>&gt;<i> left over from some other code). Line 323 has an instruction 
</I>&gt;<i> commented
</I>&gt;<i> out -- can we just get rid of it? Same with line 60 of edit.asm. See
</I>&gt;<i> if there are any other comments you can add to explain things.
</I>Yeah, I forgot to clean up a few parts. Line 27 was originally supposed 
to call a function that replaced &quot;control codes&quot; in the prompt with 
things like the time or date etc. but I thought that may be a little 
unwieldy and overkill for a first build.

&gt;<i> If you can fix those and re-send the code, that'd be great! Otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> it looks ready to go into 4.2 -- nice work. Thanks!
</I>I'll finish it up... Hmm, I think I have two hours of computers class 
today. I'll get my tools onto a USB drive and do it then.
