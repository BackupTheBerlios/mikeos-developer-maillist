<PRE>Howdy folks!

I know, I haven't been around for a while. Real life got in the way of 
my code hacking, and I also think I need a bit more time studying some 
other OSes before attempting one of my own. But now I'm back -- right 
before school starts again, darn -- and full of ideas! Unfortunately, I 
can't seem to find a couple things in MikeOS that would be accessible to 
user programs:

  - It seems that there's no way of exposing the full version string of 
MikeOS to a program. This isn't a critical issue, but it would be useful 
for programs that are dependent on, say, the space between the end of 
the kernel and the disk buffer.
  - Similarly, there's no easy way for programs to determine the 
endpoint of the kernel so they can take advantage of the extra space 
between the end of the kernel and the disk buffer. There's a good 8 KB 
usable in there.

Also, I have a few other ideas for the kernel, but I think I'll keep 
them to myself since MikeOS is supposed to be a simple OS project.

Cheers to everyone for the great work on the project!
