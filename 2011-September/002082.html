<PRE>&gt;<i>hold off until 0.40
</I>Sure, just let me know when to start!

&gt;<i>releasing the first version of the MikeOS Extended Text  Editor!
</I>&gt;<i>based off of the default text editor and has a few useful new features,
</I>&gt;<i>such as the ability to create new text files and to change the filename
</I>&gt;<i>in the editor (useful as a proto-Save As).
</I>Wait, so now we don't have to add a save file line to EXAMPLE.BAS?
We don't have to copy and delete applications in file manager?
That's awesome, thanks! How about a function key for page up/down?
I'm really looking forward to using this project.

Unfortunately I get a black screen with a flashing cursor when I try to
load it. Ctl+Alt+Del still work, so it's not locked up. Infinite loop?
I downloaded it from the attachment and sent it to my floppy disk and
booted. I called the file &quot;edit-ext.bin&quot; on the disk, is that okay?
I also have quite a lot of files on my MikeOS disk. My version is 4.1.1
and before you ask, it was built before NASM started screwing up MikeOS
with optimization enabled (in case you missed it that was the reason for
4.1.2). Need any more info?

I started a Google Code page, could the links on the MikeOS be changed
to the stable links on my download page (not latest).
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mikebasic-applications/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/mikebasic-applications/downloads/list</A>
I think this is a good think because now I can release code without
all the stuff I need to do before it's a stable package.

I'm interest in using the other 48K of RAM by the way?

Can someone tell me all the OS's that use MikeBASIC because I want to
make sure my code runs on the or if I need changes. The website isn't helping.

Phew, long E-mail.
