<PRE>Yep, that's what I meant, I have my linux machine for development because frankly, it's easier than a windows machine. (I love bash scripts and python, and it's less annoying to use than in windows.)

I have the Dos machine to break as I see fit =)

And I'm a technician in a computer shop, so I have access to a lot of machines with a lot of different hardware! =]

Thanks Justin.

Remember that the DOS machine is only for you to learn real 16 bit assembly on.
It's always better this way as then you don't have other &quot;layers&quot; of a OS like XP
getting in the way.

On windows, when you run in a dos box, you are actually running under a dos emulator
called ntvm which does place restrictions on your 16 bit code such as no privileged
instructions so direct port and device access is out the window.
Ntvm also emulates the BIOS (very badly) and as a result not all BIOS ints return
the right or expected data.

By the running under a VM also has it's quirks and disadvantages.
That is why I recommend a true DOS machine for experimenting on.

As regards editing/compiling MikeOS, you can pretty much do that on just about
any Windows or Linux machine.
Same goes for booting and trying out MikeOS.

Paulo.
