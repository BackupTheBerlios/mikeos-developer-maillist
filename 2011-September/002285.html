<PRE>Fixed all the bugs everyone's reporting, thanks guys.

&gt;<i>Memedit is very nice, but could be made
</I>&gt;<i> more user friendly by having the ASCII char
</I>&gt;<i> on the right also highlighted same as the
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding HEX byte on the left.
</I>&gt;<i>  I would also prefer to have the line numbers
</I>&gt;<i>  and offsets in hex as opposed to decimal.
</I>
Now does double columns.
Location number is in hexdecimal.
Goto's have also been changes to use hex-decimal.
Offsets will stay the same.
Fixed in Memory Manipulator 2.3.2

&gt;<i>After terminating calc.bas, the screen stays
</I>&gt;<i>   blank until a key is pressed which then goes
</I>&gt;<i>  back to the editor.
</I>&gt;<i>  This could be confusing to someone, thinking
</I>&gt;<i>  it has crashed.
</I>
This bug didn't happen for me. What did you do to get it?
Tell me your kernel version and version of Calculator.

&gt;<i>Also found a typo in the main screen of the pgm
</I>&gt;<i>it says ANCII Art Creator.
</I>
Seriously, the title. Fixed in ASCII Artist 1.0.2

&gt;<i>I'm sure that means American Nonstandard Code for Information Interchange...
</I>Haha, true. Every operating system seems to use it differently.

&gt;<i>Draw.bas crashes after loading a file.
</I>Only load picture files.

&gt;<i>you could make the file format have a
</I>&gt;<i>three-byte header (eg &quot;DRW&quot;), which isn't displayed on the screen but
</I>&gt;<i>written to the start of a file during a file-save operation.
</I>
Maybe next version, that would stop all my pictures from working.

&gt;<i>How about DRW01?
</I>
Okay, that sounds good.

&gt;<i>When clearing the screen, it doesn't clear the very leftmost column
</I>
Actually that isn't saved, but the cursor won't go there now, so
Fixed in ASCII Artist 1.0.2

&gt;<i>Dividing by zero causes a total freeze (to be expected, but can we
</I>have a check for that?)

I made this trigger an error message (ERRBOX in MB++).
Fixed in Calculator 1.0.2

&gt;<i>Mike, now that you mention the operations of calc,
</I>&gt;<i>any operation that has a result greater than 65535
</I>&gt;<i>goes back to zero.
</I>&gt;<i>e.g.  65535+1 =0     32768 X 2 = 0
</I>&gt;<i>I know that MikeOS is a 16 bit OS, but surely the calc
</I>&gt;<i>should use the FPU rather?
</I>
There is no operations in MikeBASIC for 32-bit variables.

&gt;<i>The new miketron draws really slow. Unsure if this was intended.
</I>
When travelling up an down the speed is halved. This is to compensate
for the vertical larger size of the characters. Otherwise it looks
too fast. So yes, this was intended. If it's left and right that's
slow then we may have a problem.

&gt;<i>Should I leave certain ones alone? (i.e. divide by zero in calc) for the
</I>&gt;<i>respective owners to fix? I do not want to step on any toes.
</I>
Well, I've fixed them for now, but if you want to fix any bugs in future,
go ahead! You can email it to me and tell me what you changed and I'll
verify it and put it on my Google code. Just make sure your using the
latest version. Links on the MikeOS site point to the stable versions.
You can go here: <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mikebasic-applications/">http://code.google.com/p/mikebasic-applications/</A> for the
latest version (if there isn't one use stable).

&gt;<i>once your adventure game is done and tested, I'll put it on the MikeOS site.
</I>
Can't wait to see it. I tried to make one (with strong free software
references) but gave up, I'm a developer not a writer.

&gt;<i>I'm &quot;showing you the code&quot; :-)  for
</I>&gt;<i>AND, XOR and OR logical functions
</I>&gt;<i>added to MikeBASIC.
</I>&gt;<i>&amp; = logical AND
</I>&gt;<i>^ = logical XOR
</I>&gt;|<i> = logical OR
</I>
That's great, that would be really useful!

I've updated Memory Manipulator, ASCII Artist and Calculator.
I also release a new unstable version of MB++ today.
They should be linked to the MikeOS site but changelog and downloads
are on my Google Code: <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mikebasic-applications/">http://code.google.com/p/mikebasic-applications/</A>

Good, I think that's all cleared up.
