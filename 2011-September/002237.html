<PRE>Hi all,

As promised some more info on the VGA port
for modern computers and screens.

Note that the VGA pins I refer to are also
available on DVI just the pin numbers are different.

First a bit of history, before circa 1999 monitor
identification was done by means of either shorting
pins 4,11,12,15 to gnd (pin 5) or let them float.
This would indicate the type of monitor connected
colour, b/w, resolution or no monitor connected.

With the higher resolution modes becoming the
standard, this method was no longer satisfactory
and a new one was created called EDID which
is based on the standard I2C protocol.

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C</A>

What EDID did is re-use pin 12 for SDA
(bi-directional data) and pin 15 as SCL (clock).
Pin 5 is still the gnd (common).

In the monitor, the manufactures put a serial
I2C EEPROM with details such as model, name,
scan rates supported, etc etc.

A typical eeprom used:

<A HREF="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc0180.pdf">http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc0180.pdf</A>


Pins 4 and 11 are now &quot;obsolete&quot; but still connected
on many monitors, video cards and cables.
You could experiment with these two pins
and by calling INT 11h, just don't short the other
two pins to gnd (12 and 15) as they are for EDID.
Most new computers ignore pins 4 and 11 and thus
even if you change the state of pins 4 &amp; 11 and
then execute an INT 11h, I doubt you will see a
change in the bios data area at 0040:0010
still it's worth a try especially if you have
older equipment.

For those with newer equipment, the only way
is to use EDID, but before doing so it's best
to test to see if your setup supports it.
The chances are very very good that it does.

Below is a simple pgm to test it.
Compile with A86 (or with small changes NASM)
and then run it under a true DOS machine
using DEBUG.

====================================
jmp MainPgm

EdidBuffer db 256 dup 0

MainPgm:

mov ax,4F15h
mov bx,01
xor cx,cx
xor dx,dx
mov di, offset EdidBuffer
int 10h
int 3h

====================================

Once compiled, load the resulting .com
into DEBUG and run it.
Now if AX=004Fh and BX=0001 it means it's supported.
Now (D)ump the buffer (EdidBuffer) which should be
located at CS:0102h

Here you will see 128 (80h) bytes of EDID data from
your monitor.
I will post what each byte means when I have more time
but for now you should see a whole bunch of FFh's at the
start and towards the end the model/make of your monitor.
The last byte is a checksum.

Note that although the EDID data is normally 128 bytes, some
manufactures return 256, hence the 256 bytes set aside
for EdidBuffer in the pgm above.

Since the interrupt calls above are from BIOS not DOS
(I just made the pgm to run under DOS as it's quicker),
you could write a small app for MikeOS to display
the monitor info that is connected to the computer
much like the Linux 'get-edid' tool.

For those wanting to use this rather as an I/O port
then it's quite simple, disconnect pins 12 &amp; 15
going to your monitor and then connect them to a
small micro (set to emulate I2C slave) or even use
a parallel to I2C converter such as the PCF8574.
The parallel inputs to the PCF8574 then reads your
external data and sends it to the computer in place
of the EDID data when you run the pgm.

Since MikeOS does not need the EDID data for
anything, you can now use it for whatever you want.

Have fun,
Paulo.
