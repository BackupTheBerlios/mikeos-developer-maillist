<PRE>Hi Bazza,

Interesting thoughts. My take:

&gt;<i> A need a FIXED set of addresses to use as I/O store, so I have decided on locations
</I>&gt;<i> 65528 to 65535 inclusive.
</I>
I think we need to be really careful about changing the memory layout.
Right now it's really simple: programs can assume they have entire
control over the top 32K of the segment. If we start stealing a few
bytes here and there, it's no longer clean.

We don't have to go crazy about compatibility, but there may be some
MikeOS hackers out there with programs using that 32K in various ways,
and we could break their work by changing the function of certain
bytes.

&gt;<i> It looks as though you are using SS: at 0x0000: an sp at 0xFFFF...
</I>
Correct!

&gt;<i> SO I have decided to steal the top 8 bytes for BIOS variable storage.
</I>
There is a precedent for this. If you look in kernel.asm, there's a
'SYSTEM VARIABLES' section that was created by the guy who wrote the
time and date routines. It provides a system-wide way to change
settings.

However, wouldn't the cleanest solution to all this be: just implement
it as part of the API? You're doing MikeOS work, you need to do
something that's not easily achievable through the normal methods, so
therefore it's a missing feature I reckon.

Couldn't we just add your os_key_flags to the API (and a BASIC hook),
with it returning the value in AL rather than poking it into RAM
somewhere? What do you reckon?
