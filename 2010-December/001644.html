<PRE>Well WinUAE anyhow... ;)

Here`s the story:-

I`ve been struggling to get 256 colour images in PCX format to display in MikeOS.

On reading the ultra-short guff about viewing 320x200x16 colour images and seeing
test.pcx had more than 16 colours then this didn`t make any sense at all.

So decided to use an ancient AMIGA program ADPro 2.5.

This is superb for finding small details quickly.

I had already deduced that there was at least 32 colours at a quick glance but ADPro
tells no lies. &quot;test.pcx&quot; has 64 colours.

Well saved the my image as a 64 colour &quot;floyd dithered&quot; image and tried to display
it in MikeOS - ZAP, once again crash.

So decided to take another look at test.pcx and noticed it was quantised rather than
dithered and also read the viewer.asm.

AHA! It all falls into place the image size cannot be greater than 28KB. Read the code
to find out why.

Re-did my image quantised and voila it was inside 28KB and now works.

So I can have crude photgraphs of the projects ENTIRELY in MikeOS format now
without the need for any other OS at all...

COOL.

I wonder if I can modify the code to write to 0xA0000 directly as this would make
the images much better and quantisation would not be needed?
Nah, probably easier to use Mike`s method... :D

The AMIGA A1200 in WinUAE mode is still the best machine on the planet. :-O
ADPro 2.5 is still my image processor of choice and blistering quick also.

I await the flak... :D
