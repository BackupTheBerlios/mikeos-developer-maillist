<PRE>Hi Matthew...

Before diving into MikeOS try out some very simple coding so that you can see
what is going on inside a known OS, Windows...

For example learn what the different registers do by writing something like:-
(Set the ORG to 100h or 256 decimal.)

start:
mov ax,10
mov ax,0x10
xor ax,ax
cmp ax,0
jnz start
ret

Call the code as test.asm

Compile it using say NASM in the NSAM drawer as &quot;test&quot;.

We will use DEBUG.EXE and trace each instruction.

Lets say your NASM.EXE is in C:\SOME\PATH\NASM\

So from C:\SOME\PATH\NASM\ do the following:-

C:\SOME\PATH\NASM\DEBUG.EXE test&lt;RETURN&gt;

You will be confronted with flashing cursor on the next line to the far left hand side.

Do the following...

_u&lt;RETURN&gt;

(A listing will now appear of your code.)

_t&lt;RETURN&gt;

You will now see AX with a hex value 000Ah corresponding to DECIMAL 10.
TAKE NOTE of all of the other registers AND the flags and compare with the previous
readings if any.

_t&lt;RETURN&gt;

Again you will see AX with a new value of 0010h.
TAKE NOTE of all of the other registers AND the flags and compare with the previous
readings if any.

_t&lt;RETURN&gt;

Again you will see AX with a new value 0000h.
TAKE NOTE of all of the other registers AND the flags and compare with the previous
readings if any.

_t&lt;RETURN&gt;

TAKE NOTE of all of the other registers AND the flags and compare with the previous
readings if any. NOTE the flags...

_t&lt;RETURN&gt;

TAKE NOTE of all of the other registers AND the flags and compare with the previous
readings if any. NOTE the flags...

_t&lt;RETURN&gt;

As AX == 0000h then the &quot;jnz&quot;, (jump not zero), is ignored.

_t&lt;RETURN&gt;

You will now &quot;ret&quot;urn from this &quot;test&quot; routine.

_q&lt;RETURN&gt;

To quit the DEBUG.EXE back to the MS-DOS window.

This may seem a silly bit of coding but if you now take my &quot;Hello World.&quot; and
correct it for NASM, (it is written for AD86), and set the ORG to 100h or 256 decimal
and do the same you will see many things going on. The &quot;es:&quot; part of the code
will be a tester if you don`t know what you are doing with NASM...

Don`t run before you can walk.

Some people pick up assembly code easily others have to work at it like me.
If I am not sure about a routine I write something similar that will do no damage
to the system whilst testing the idea(s).

So for the time being ignore MikeOS and use an MS-DOS in a window where
SIMPLE known tools are easily obtainable from the OS itself rather than as add-ons.

I`m sure Mike and the rest of us will be pretty helpful as you start to progress.





And lastly for MIKE.

JOG my memory to compile the kernel with the new os_pause added for this WE
and test with the BASIC code by slapping me, or maybe emailing me IF YOU
remember. :)
