<PRE>Hi all,

It's been a while since I've posted anything as work commitments have taken up all my time.
Anyways, have a few moments spare so I thought I'll try get MikeOS to boot off a USB flash drive.

The problem I'm having is that which ever PC I try and boot off, it can't find the kernel although the
MikeOS bootloader runs ok.
I've tried setting the BIOS to boot off USB-HDD, USB-FDD and USB-ZIP, nothing, always get the
bootloader's error message of &quot;KERNEL.BIN&quot; not found or simply the usual BIOS message that no boot disk found
depending on what I set the BIOS to boot from.

I tried using Flashnul but my anti-virus was not very happy with it (don't know if it was a false positive)
but I ain't taking any chances.
Plus one learns nothing by simply using precompiled programs.

So the method I used as follows:

- insert usb flash drive, start WinHex and Zero all the sectors.
- use dd as follows:
  dd if=c:\mikeos\mikeos41.ima of=\\.\f:   (my flash drive is f: and the .ima is simply the .flp renamed to .ima so that WinImage will open it).

This process definitely seems to work as my machine running XP pro SP2 can see the newly &quot;formatted&quot; flash drive
and confirms that it is FAT12 and so does WinHex, yet the PCs refuse to boot from it.
See attached screen shots.

What am I doing wrong/forgetting?
Any suggestions greatly appreciated.
Regards,
Paulo.

P.S.

Tried to post before but it was rejected as the attachment was too large.
Decreased their resolution and trying again.
