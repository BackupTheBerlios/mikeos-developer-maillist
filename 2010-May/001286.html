<PRE>Mike,

I'm sure this is the way to overcome these problems.
I just hope our old &quot;friends&quot; the Service Packs don't come into play.
Remember there is SP1, 2 and 3.

&gt;<i> As there's no 'dd' as standard in Windows I presume it's this <A HREF="http://www.chrysocome.net/dd">http://www.chrysocome.net/dd</A>
</I>
Yep, that's the one.

&gt;<i> I notice that there's a '--filter=removable' option, which appears to
</I>&gt;<i> negate the need to rename the 'dd.exe' binary. If you could test it
</I>
No problem.
Will do so later today and get back to you.

Other points you should make mention of in the documentation:

1) I remember reading somewhere that some BIOS' also require the &quot;enable USB legacy emulation&quot; feature to be set
   before booting from anything USB.

2) Some flash drives have that stupid built in autorun feature which is on a separate &quot;read only&quot; section of the drive.
   This could wreak havoc with trying to boot MikeOS from those drives.
   As far as I'm aware, the only way to get rid of it is to use the utility from the manufacturer to change/remove it.
   I could be wrong.

Considering that flash drives can be had for as little as a fiver these days, it's worth getting a whole lot of different ones
and trying them out.

Paulo.
