How so? The in-kernel editor would load and execute BASIC programs at
327678. Right now, every BASIC program is already capable of running
from that point (ie when they're launched from the main menu), and
indeed should be able to run anywhere (given enough free space at the
end). No programs should stop working from this change.

&gt;<i> * We can (and IMO should have already) start using resb/resw in place of

</I>
But like you say, that only affects the on-disk size, which isn't an
issue at this stage (we're wallowing in free space on the disk).
However, you're right that perhaps we could do more to share buffers
between routines, being careful to avoid problems if one routine calls
another.

The idea of a memory manager for the kernel itself is intriguing.
There are certainly times when buffers could be &quot;freed&quot; for other uses
(eg string_vars in BASIC when BASIC isn't running), but we'd still
have to be extra careful that there's enough space for when one
memory-requesting routine calls another.

How doable would be a two-segment model, do you think? One segment for
the kernel, and one for user programs? How could the &quot;user&quot; segment
call routines in the kernel -- via interrupts? I've always wanted to
avoid the segmentation mess, but if there's a way to implement this
fairly cleanly and simply, it'd be tempting. Sure, it'd break
compatibility, but it'd give us so much more free room for new
features in future.
