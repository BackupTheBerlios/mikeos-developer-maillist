M,
 

&gt;<i> Oh and Dan, I see on your site that &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mikeos-developer">developer374 at gmail.com</A>&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> leaving messages. 
</I> 
Where? I can't see any?
 
&gt;<i> He doesn't understand assembly, he doesn't understand 16-bit numbers,
</I>&gt;<i> he doesn't understand programming at all, he can't write proper
</I>&gt;<i> English and yet every other day he sends me completely bizarre,
</I>&gt;<i> totally useless rubbish. He keeps trying to get on the list, again and
</I>&gt;<i> again, and it's getting to the point of harassment. He's seriously
</I>&gt;<i> mentally ill; please avoid him at all costs.
</I> 
Thanks for the heads up. I take it you have made the mistake of helping him before?
 
I don't think he is a troll or anything - as somebody like that would want the short term reaction. This is too long term for a troller. He genuinely sounds ill. I couldn't find any other trace of him on the internet. I take it 'Mikey Sirbirt' is a mock version of 'Mike Saunders'. I honeslty don't know who you would contact about him. It's not as if there is an internet police as yet. He always appears to try through hotmail and Gmail...
 
It seems really unfair on you - and other developers on this list to put up with his rubbish - specially as you have all achieved so much. I'll do some asking around...
