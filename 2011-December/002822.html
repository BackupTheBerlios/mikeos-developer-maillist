It could be amusing if you merged all his &quot;changes&quot; into one file for 
us to gawk at. Sure, it's kind of mean, but if you don't want him here 
at all, does it really matter?

But yeah, he seems nuts.


Dan: I'm at a loss for words as to why your code isn't working. Perhaps 
it's initialization-related? If you could post a link to the whole 
section of code related to mouse functions, we may be able to help you a 
little more. Context means a lot when debugging.


Slightly unrelated: I have written code that manages to cause 
VirtualBox to crash. Not the OS inside it, but VirtualBox itself. I have 
no idea what I've done to cause this, either.
