&gt;<i> Did you remember to change to mode 13h before hand? It might help if
</I>&gt;<i> you tell me what output you see.
</I> 
Yeah. It was another peice of code many many many lines up. I don't get an output in a normal scenario. If I invert the output (when .bit_up = 0) then I just get a completely coloured square (5x7 pixels).

&gt;<i> I think it would be a lot simpler to write/understand if you didn't
</I>&gt;<i> pack the data, it would only be 35 bytes anyway.
</I>
Well, I was going to use the peice of code to write letters to the screen aswell. If each character takes up 35 bytes instead of 5 bytes, 256 characters later we are looking at 8960 bytes against 1280 bytes. It would save in the long run.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; mov ax, dx
</I>&gt;<i> In line 43 you transfer DX into AX then add then you add the video
</I>&gt;<i> segment (A000h) to it.
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing DX could be is the high byte from the multiplication,
</I>&gt;<i> which will be zero unless
</I>&gt;<i> there are at least 518 rows. I'm unsure what your trying to do here,
</I>&gt;<i> can't you just do &quot;mov ax, 0xA000&quot; ?
</I> 
I did at one point but it wouldn't work. It was only when I changed it did it work. It was a solution to a problem a long way back - I can't remember what I was solving by doing it now. All I know is that it was needed at the time of writing.

&gt;<i> It is unnecessary to set the video segment each time you want to set one pixel.
</I>
I know - it was literally to see if I could get the code going first - then worry about optmizing it.
 
&gt;<i> Sorry about all the questions, but you didn't have very much detail or
</I>&gt;<i> code comments.
</I>
Don't worry about it - questions are good. I am sorry about the lack of commenting. It was literally just a case of trying to get it churning out what I wanted.
 
&gt;<i> PS Get Gmail
</I>
Already have. Just use hotmail for the mikeos developer mailing list :)
 
Incase you are woundering - the project I am working on is - <A HREF="http://www.heluxresearch.info">http://www.heluxresearch.info</A> - which will explain the major optimization of code...
