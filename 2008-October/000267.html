<PRE>&gt;<i>It'd be a chore using 16-bit registers, yep, so 32-bit would make it
</I>&gt;<i>much simpler. But in fact, FAT32 is easier to work with in many
</I>&gt;<i>respects because the FAT entries fall neatly on byte boundaries
</I>&gt;<i>(rather than FAT12, in which you have to keep shifting or masking bits
</I>&gt;<i>depending on if it's an odd or even cluster).
</I>
Yeah, I had noticed that! I just thought I was being wierd because I thought
the arrangement of FAT32 looked conceptually easier to understand that FAT12
(I get this a lot, but not usually with an adequate explanation, which may
explain my ambitious choices of universities...)

&gt;<i>You have to handle varying sectors per cluster (whereas it's always
</I>&gt;<i>one in FAT12) but that's no biggie. But otherwise it's largely the
</I>&gt;<i>same and easier to deal with thanks to the FAT entries being
</I>&gt;<i>double-words!
</I>
I'm still using some public domain code to get me started on a FAT driver
though as I haven't a clue where to start (despite knowing the theory behind
it)! It will still be mostly unique however as I'll need to tweak it heavily
to work with the rest of the kernel and also to work with an API which
MikeOS developers may find vaguely familiar (in terms of function names,
anyway!).

However, I will still be looking at the MikeOS floppy driver with interest!
