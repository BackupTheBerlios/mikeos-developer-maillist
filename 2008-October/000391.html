<PRE>Well it does say 'similar OS' in the title... ;)

I'm having some problems getting a CLI working in ApolloOS. It's based on
bkerndev (I'm porting MikeOS's floppy driver for 0.1) and I've linked the
cli.c file with system.h, and the relevant functions all work.

The problem I have at the moment is with an IF() statement in the keyboard
driver. My aim is to (when the user presses enter) to call a function to
process their command (stored as a string). In all other cases, I just want
to add the ASCII character to a string, which I can process later.

Things seemed to be going well, but at the moment my driver doesn't
differentiate between enter and the other keys on the keyboard! As a result
you can press any key and it runs my CLI function (which at the moment just
outputs 'You Pressed Enter!', as I need to get this working before I start
processing commands).

Does anyone know any good scancodes or ways of grabbing enter? I've probably
missed something obvious... Here's some code:

void keyboard_handler(struct regs *r)
{
    unsigned char scancode; /* this stores the scancode*/
    char *commandString;   /* Holds command as string to be passed to
function */
    int cmd = 0; /* This is the handler variable for me to add characters to
the string */


    /* Read from the keyboard's data buffer */
    scancode = inportb(0x60);

    /* If the top bit of the byte we read from the keyboard is
    *  set, that means that a key has just been released */
    if (scancode &amp; 0x80)
    {
        /* You can use this one to see if the user released the
        *  shift, alt, or control keys... */
    }
    else
    {
        /* Here, a key was just pressed. Please note that if you
        *  hold a key down, you will get repeated key press
        *  interrupts. */

        /* Just to show you how this works, we simply translate
        *  the keyboard scancode into an ASCII value, and then
        *  display it to the screen. You can get creative and
        *  use some flags to see if a shift is pressed and use a
        *  different layout, or you can add another 128 entries
        *  to the above layout to correspond to 'shift' being
        *  held. If shift is held using the larger lookup table,
        *  you would add 128 to the scancode when you look for it */
    if (kbdus[scancode]='\n') /* This is one of my  attempts - I've also
tried scancode = x, where x is a hex scancode */
    {
        cli_handle_string(commandString); /* if enter is pressed, send the
command string to the CLI handler */
    }
    else
    {
            putch(kbdus[scancode]); /* else, business as usual... */
        commandString[cmd] = kbdus[scancode]; /* add character to string -
or array if you like! */
        cmd++; /* increment my char array handler */
    }
    }
}

kbdus is the function which converts scancodes to ASCII characters.

Thanks in advance ;)
