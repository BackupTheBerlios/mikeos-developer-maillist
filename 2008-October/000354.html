<PRE>GRUB and protected mode will never happen for MikeOS -- at least, not
under the current project. Maybe one day there'll be scope for a PM
MikeOS spin-off, and of course anyone is free to make one, but it's a
no-go area for now :-)

&gt;<i> Breaking down modules into 'components' is a good idea. After all, when you
</I>&gt;<i> start adding drivers (which are inevitable with protected mode) separating
</I>&gt;<i> 'kernel' from 'driver' can be very important (as I'm finding out with
</I>&gt;<i> ApolloOS!).
</I>
Yeppers. They'll still be pulled into the main kernel file, but in
organising the code more cleanly, it should make it easy for others to
benefit. For instance, if someone wants to use a FAT12 driver or
string handling routines in their OS, they can look at or re-use the
appropriate code without poring through syscalls.asm.

&gt;<i> Why do you need 64K and a 512K external program segments - or is this for
</I>&gt;<i> binaries to go in one and operations to go in the other? (hmmm...)
</I>
Well, as mentioned, unreal mode doesn't provide flat memory benefits
for CS:IP so we still need to work with 64K segments for executable
code. Hence why I'm thinking of one segment for the kernel, and one
segment for applications. We're still wallowing in free RAM, however,
so I think marking 512K of space for programs to use (ie file data,
image data etc.) would be useful.

I've only briefly looked over the workings of unreal mode so I may be
missing something, but this looks feasible. Then programs will have
plenty of space to do more interesting stuff.

&gt;<i> MikeOS (which would be getting far more complex). At least then you could
</I>&gt;<i> still call MikeOS a 'learning tool'! (If you would like me to write this
</I>&gt;<i> document, I'd be more than happy to ;) )
</I>
Cool, thanks! I actually want to make MikeOS simpler for 3.0 --
simpler codebase, more comments, better structuring of the source
code, and a crystal clear memory map (instead of the current
lump-it-all-into-64K situation). Currently, the 'Making an OS' guide
in the Handbook serves as an introduction to the skills required for
working on the MikeOS internals, but as things change for 3.0, it
might need to be rewritten. So we can talk about new guides closer to
the time -- and it'd be great to get input from someone who's not too
wrapped up in the code like me!

Cheers,
Mike
