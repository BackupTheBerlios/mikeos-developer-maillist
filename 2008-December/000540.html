I've thought about that before, but ultimately I've opted against it.
A wiki has some benefits, undoubtedly, but it introduces certain
problems into a project like MikeOS:

1) It's yet another source of documentation. Right now we have the
Handbook, a single, (mostly!) complete source of information that's
all in a single HTML file that needs nothing else. It's influenced
heavily by the FreeBSD Handbook. Converting a bunch of wiki files into
a standalone doc (or three docs as in MikeOS 3) is extra hassle.

2) With lots of different people chipping in, you run the risk of
information overlap, different writing styles etc., thereby losing the
consistency we want to achieve.

3) Wikis are ideal for projects that are constantly evolving and have
new, bleeding-edge ideas/code that need to be documented quickly.
MikeOS is (or will be!) a lot more stable than that -- the Handbook
should strive to be 'perfect' for the latest release, and ideally not
tweaking.

Of course, all Handbook updates are welcome, but like the OS itself I
want everything to be as consistent and settled as possible until we
make another jump (ie write stuff for 3.1). So a wiki is useful for a
project like TomOS which is moving around rapidly, but not necessary
for a project like this.

That said, one of the goals for 3.0 is to make application programming
easier, so perhaps a wiki after the release where coders can share
snippets etc. will be doable. But I'll think about that after 3.0 :-)
