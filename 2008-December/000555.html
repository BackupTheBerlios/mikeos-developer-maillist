<PRE>Something I studied on my own I'm afraid (showing my nerdy-ness once
again!). I initially came across it when I was trying to teach myself Pascal
(just after my first attempts with MikeOS), and found that Octal was far
easier to use for binary arithmetic and binary itself!

I think Octal is a little underused, on the basis that businesses seemed to
favour people with binary and hex skills. But they still teach it in
Computer Science degrees (as the tutors at these University open days I keep
going to tell me), and Octal is a far easier way of working with byte values
(I feel). After all, a user can either be confronted with 1010010b or 122o
(the latter makes it easier to spot that we are working with the 12th byte +
2 bits (in the case of memory addressing) or a total of 82 (

12 8 + 2 as opposed to

26 + 24 + 2)

(The above hasn't rendered very well, but gmail isn't very good with
powers!).

It isn't seen a lot in modern code (as we tend to leave these low level
operation behind with high level languages) but I feel it is conceptually
easier than using binary. It's your OS though, so I will leave the decision
with you on that one. ;)
