<PRE>Note : I am very much aware that segmentation is extremely a complex and a
toedious task in Real Mode.
My goal is to achieve this :
Small little 64K segment
+++++++++++++
Kernel - 24K
Disk Buffer - 8K
Extra Space - 32K
+++++++++++++
+++++++++++++
[EMPTY 64K Segment]
+++++++++++++
Now THIS IS TOUGH! Firstly I don't want to do anything with that 32K app
space, it would be a tedious task to rewrite the apps with org 65530 or
something like that plus Joshua apps like Yotta which are not open source
won't
run on this.
Also before I set out on this project,
I'd like to understand the os_main function
cli ; Clear interrupts
mov ax, 0
mov ss, ax ; Set stack segment and pointer
mov sp, 0FFFFh
sti
I understand CLI and STI, but I have a doubt,
SS = 0 Right?
SP = 0xFFFh Right?
So to my understanding this is the one that gives us our 64K segment? Or is
there
some thing wrong in my understanding?
And here :
mov ax, 2000h ; Set all segments to match where kernel is loaded mov ds, ax
; After this, we don't need to bother with mov es, ax ; segments ever
again, as MikeOS and its programs mov fs, ax ; live entirely in 64K mov gs,
ax
I think the secret to the next 64K segment lies here,
But I am not able to figure it out, I checked the Segmentation page on OSDev
about this but they give really limited knowledge of what to do with these
segments.
Does anyone have articles, pages, wikis that thoroughly explains x86 Memory
Segmentation?
PS: The other &quot;EMPTY 64K Segment would be used for something special&quot;
which I am trying to develop, I have almost developed it, but it requires
another
segment to load, it would still work in that 32K segment, but......
~Help would be appreciated...............
