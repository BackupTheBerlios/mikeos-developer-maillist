<PRE>&gt;<i>I can't find a specific mailing list or email address about TachyonOS, so I'm posting here.
</I>It is a little tricky to find. You can email me about anything
TachyonOS related. Try <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mikeos-developer">mikeosdeveloper at gmail.com.</A>

&gt;<i>When I try the programme Mouse API Test, moving my wireless mouse doesn't work, and moving my touchpad seems to crash the system
</I>I'll assume you mean the featured program in build #006. The
interfaces you are using are a little unusual, unfortunately it will
only work for mice that can run in PS/2 emulation. Try using a wired
mouse or better, an emulator.

&gt;<i>Thank you very much :) I'll take a gander and see what I can work out!
</I>It's an interesting project you've got. I hope you can fit the driver
in your limited kernel space!

&gt;<i>What would make that version better?
</I>More helpful comments and better ordering. The code is essentially the same.

&gt;<i>Also, the variables sitting at the bottom of both MOUSE driver files, do they need to be setup prior to the file being compiled or is it done during run time?
</I>
No setup required, the mouse driver handles them at runtime.
There is a little bit of setup required on the operating system's
behalf however.
Before using the mouse API, the operating system must install the
driver and setup a proper range and scale.
The scale is a value the raw position is shifted by to reduced the
speed of the mouse depending on the resolution/aspect ratio of the
screen. The range is the minimum and maximum positions of the mouse,
this is usually the number of pixels/character on the screen but can
be useful for locking the mouse to a specific area.
TachyonOS uses the following boot code to initialize the mouse for
80x25 text mode.

call os_mouse_setup
mov ax, 0
mov bx, 0
mov cx, 79
mov dx, 24
call os_mouse_range
mov dh, 3
mov dl, 2
call os_mouse_scale
