<PRE>You would be better off taking a look at the guides on <A HREF="http://wiki.osdev.org.">http://wiki.osdev.org.</A>

I know what you're thinking. &quot;Hmm... this would be great if I could use more segments/memory/cowbell!&quot;. Soon you'll discover that just bolting on segments doesn't actually achieve very much. So, you look into how segments are loaded at boot time and discover this is needlessly difficult/also pointless because nothing MikeOS does is made much better. Then you realise that what you were trying to do all along is better achieved with a pmode kernel with page memory addressing using C instead of ASM!

I'd suggest trying to write some cool things using MikeBASIC before trying to hack away at the realmode kernel that runs in 32K, progress onto ASM applications that don't require the MikeBASIC interpretter THEN hack away at the kernel. Alternatively you could always study MikeOS spin-offs like TomOS which take things further to get some ideas for your own respin :)

Note : I am very much aware that segmentation is extremely a complex and a toedious task in Real Mode.
My goal is to achieve this :
Small little 64K segment
+++++++++++++
Kernel - 24K
Disk Buffer - 8K
Extra Space - 32K
+++++++++++++
+++++++++++++
[EMPTY 64K Segment]
+++++++++++++
Now THIS IS TOUGH! Firstly I don't want to do anything with that 32K app
space, it would be a tedious task to rewrite the apps with org 65530 or&#160;
something like that plus Joshua apps like Yotta which are not open source won't
run on this.
Also before I set out on this project,&#160;
I'd like to understand the os_main function
cli ; Clear interrupts
mov ax, 0
mov ss, ax ; Set stack segment and pointer
mov sp, 0FFFFh
sti
I understand CLI and STI, but I have a doubt,
SS = 0 Right?
SP = 0xFFFh Right?
So to my understanding this is the one that gives us our 64K segment? Or is there
some thing wrong in my understanding?
And here :
mov ax, 2000h ; Set all segments to match where kernel is loaded mov ds, ax ; After this, we don't need to bother with mov es, ax ; segments ever again, as MikeOS and its programs mov fs, ax ; live entirely in 64K mov gs, ax
I think the secret to the next 64K segment lies here,
But I am not able to figure it out, I checked the Segmentation page on OSDev
about this but they give really limited knowledge of what to do with these segments.
Does anyone have articles, pages, wikis that thoroughly explains x86 Memory Segmentation?
PS: The other &quot;EMPTY 64K Segment would be used for something special&quot;
which I am trying to develop, I have almost developed it, but it requires another
segment to load, it would still work in that 32K segment, but......
~Help would be appreciated...............
