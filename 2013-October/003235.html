<PRE>&gt;<i>Sounds really similar to my memory manager which I posted in August 2012.
</I>&gt;<i>I guess there's really only one way you can implement such a simple memory
</I>&gt;<i>manager.
</I>I forgot about that. I just needed a simple memory manager for my
program, so I got some theory from the OSDev wiki. I guess there's
only so many ways one can implement the wheel!
One difference between the initialisation is, your memory manager
allocates all the memory after a given point while mine uses a defined
area.

On TachyonOS I created a system that used a bitmap with a large block
sizes and handles. Since the owner of each block was marked on the
bitmap and the blocks in a handle could be non-sequential, it had the
advantage of being immune to fragmentation. However it was more a
system of swapping memory with a larger memory mass than managing
memory.

&gt;<i>Mine only uses a 1-word header though; the highest bit indicates whether
</I>&gt;<i>the block is free or not. You only need 15 bits for the size because the
</I>&gt;<i>heap is never going to be larger than 32K, unless you leave the kernel
</I>&gt;<i>segment.
</I>
This is pretty good space efficient as every little bit of overhead
counts. I was planning on using the extra bits of support some more
advanced features. I already use a special value to mark the end of
the allocatable memory area.

&gt;<i>I think you should only merge adjacent free blocks when you can't allocate
</I>&gt;<i>a block large enough, to improve performance. Mine has the same flaw
</I>&gt;<i>though.
</I>
I disagree. It is true that merging adjacent free block causes slower
performance in freeing memory. However the performance loss is fairly
minor and there's a far worse performance loss if the memory manager
needs to sort through a lot of blocks to find one it can use, also the
memory manager will need to merge blocks on demand when allocating.
It's far easier just to keep everything organised and compact so it
will be efficient when it's needed.
