<PRE>Alright, here's how it would work.

The user would have to execute the loader, which would load the entire 
manager into the next segment above MikeOS. Then an application which 
utilizes the manager is run, and reads a small string from 1234:5678h (???) 
to ensure compatibility. To display windows, the program points the DX 
register at whichever window information block it wants, and performs a CALL 
statement. For window controls, the window ID number (specified in whichever 
info block was loaded for the window) is loaded into the AX register, and DX 
to the control's info block, and performs yet another CALL. So on and so 
forth.

That's about as far as I got whenever I wrote out the info block draft 
nearly two years ago.

At second thought, I think I'm wrong about the keyboard control part. I 
think what I had in mind to begin with was that a tab order number could be 
specified in the control info block, and the program would check if the user 
pressed Tab, which if he did, would then call &quot;control.selectNext:&quot;. There 
would of course be &quot;mov AX, controlNumber // CALL control.select&quot; and 
&quot;control.selectPrev&quot; as well.

All done in 80x25 textmode. I might try to implement lowres graphics support 
in the distant future if I'm feeling hardcore. I'm not even sure you could 
call this thing a true manager, I mean it's really just a package of screen 
drawing routines. Any real management is being handled by the program.

I've attached the original info block draft.

I have been planning a widget toolkit (i.e. a series of event driven
gadget such as textboxes) and I want to synchronise my efforts with
your window manager. I have some questions about your scheme.

What graphics mode/method are you going to use?
How are you going to draw text or primatives?
How do the windows work? Are they managed?
