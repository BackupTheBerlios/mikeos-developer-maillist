<PRE>Hello there,

&gt;&gt;<i>Also this should be the repaired version right? I mean did you implement left click function in the file selector, &gt;&gt;i.e. when I click an item in the file selector, it should open the file up, cause that doesn't seem to work with the &gt;&gt;repaired version you see you can only move the mouse around and see files on your floppy, they don't open &gt;&gt;when you click them.....
</I>
I managed to get it running ages ago although I didn't really know that much about what was really going on, let alone the mouse protocol that the code was abiding to.

The difficult part I found was to have the keyboard also work? Have you checked to see if you are still able to use the keyboard when the mouse is active or whether there is a way of switching back from using the mouse? Obviously it's possible to do it but it stumped me and I found myself spending too much time on it. I would be very interested to know if you know how to get that part working :)

Dan
