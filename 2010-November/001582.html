<PRE>Hi Paolo...
 
&gt;<i> Apparently UEFI is just like working in a shell/cmd line environment.
</I>
I already know this but I must be missing summat.

If it has a CLI then it IS an OS by definition, so defeats the object of learning
how to build a simple OS in the first place. It is an interface for simple app`s.
I will iterate Mike, just think of all of those pesky drivers for all of the HW
you would have to write. This no longer becomes a learning tool and a hobby!

Writing an OS is orders of magnitude more difficult than writing app`s.
Writing in Assembly is also orders of magnitude more difficult than writing in BASIC.
MANY people could write something in BASIC with little effort, FEW can do the same
in Assembly.

What Mike is implying is, to create an independant OS of his own he would
need to know all of the low level calls to generate his OWN CLI form the UEFI
initialisation of the HAL. Where is this information for FREE on the WWW.
The word here is FREE!

I don`t want to keep on signing into SIGs and possibly even having to donate some
money. I already GIVE away all of my ideas and don`t expect anyone to sign up
to some website and/or pay for the privelege.

For example AMINET.

(BTW I have found a way to record real time audio into STANDRAD Python for
Linux and play it back after recording in about 10 lines of STANDARD Python code.
I gave that idea away too; it`s on LXF.)

&gt;<i> See this:
</I>
&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://x86asm.net/articles/uefi-programming-first-steps/">http://x86asm.net/articles/uefi-programming-first-steps/</A>
</I>
Seen it before and no mention of a listing of calls to the HAL so that we can make
our own screen layouts and designs of UIs.

&gt;<i> I am encouraged by what I read.
</I>&gt;<i> especially the fact that UEFI has native PE file support.
</I>
Not sure why portability is good for an OS like Mike`s, maybe you can give your
opinion.
