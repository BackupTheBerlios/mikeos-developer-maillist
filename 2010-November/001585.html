<PRE>Bazza,

&gt;<i> If it has a CLI then it IS an OS by definition, so defeats the object of 
</I>&gt;<i>learning
</I>&gt;<i> how to build a simple OS in the first place.
</I>
I agree with you that it's more like a simple OS.

&gt;<i> I will iterate Mike, just think of all of those pesky drivers for all of the 
</I>HW
&gt;<i> you would have to write. 
</I>
You certainly would have to write some drivers but I also suspect that many 
would be pretty generic.
Obviously trying to use ethernet, HD audio, etc would require a driver to be 
used for specific hardware.

&gt;<i> This no longer becomes a learning tool and a hobby!
</I>
I don't agree entirely.
It certainly would be more complicated than BIOS but no more complicated than 
writing dlls.
I guess those from the Windoze world would be at an advantage here as we have 
used dlls for ever and a day.
(Heck, some of us even have to write them for a living).

&gt;<i> Writing an OS is orders of magnitude more difficult than writing app`s.
</I>
It certainly is, but a complete OS does not have to be written all in one go.

&gt;<i> Writing in Assembly is also orders of magnitude more difficult than writing in 
</I>&gt;<i>BASIC.
</I>
Yes but assembly is much more versatile and you are not restricted by the 
limitations/features of the BASIC compiler.
I certainly would not attempt to compile a 32 bit PE executable using any 
flavour of BASIC (is it even possible ?)

Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly not pushing for UEFI but at the same time 
progress is inevitable and all I'm saying
is that it ain't always that bad.

Paulo.
