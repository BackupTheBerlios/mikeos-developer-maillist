&gt;<i> I'll also look at them, 'cause that sounds like a good way to learn.
</I>
Great, the more the merrier.
Just had a quick look at the code for the old MikeOS, and there are quite a few
things that will need to be changed:

1) Version 0.49 (where the mouse driver is used) still uses DOS INTs which the 
new versions don't
    so any reference to DOS INT 33h (mouse) must not be used.

2) Version 0.49 uses screen mode 11h (640X480X2) for the gui where as the newer 
versions don't even have a gui.
    They use either mode 13h (320X200X8) for viewing pcx graphics so any mouse 
cursor would have to be for this resolution
    or mode 03h (720 X 400 colour text) for the cmd line.

 3) I don't quite know how the mouse cursor could be drawn in text mode and 
since all the os calls such as os_dialog_box, os_draw_background,
     etc are all done in mode 03h (text) this sort of defeats the object of 
having a mouse in the first place unless Mike is up to the challenge
    of re-writing or duplicating these calls for a  &quot;GUI&quot; mode.
    Drawing a mouse cursor in a graphics screen is easy as the screen data can 
be XORed with the mouse cursor bitmap in video memory.(A000h for colour VGA).

4) Then there is the fact that many new motherboards don't even have PS2 ports 
but rely on BIOS doing some kind of translation from USB keyboards and mice to 
emulated PS2.
    I wonder how well the PS2 port is emulated by BIOS as regards delays etc.

Sound like lots of fun.

Regards,
Paulo.
