There are no references to int 33h or anything like that. The mouse
driver code is separate to the DOS stuff. (There's a handler for DOS
programs calling int 33h, but it just irets back.) The mouse driver
installs its own interrupt handler.

Yes, the two are mutually exclusive. The idea when I was making the
GUI branch was to eventually replace os_dialog_box with gui_dialog_box
etc. -- ie routines that would work in the 640x480x2 mode. I don't
know what'll happen if you call os_dialog_box in GUI mode; probably
all sorts of screen corruption!

&gt;<i> 4) Then there is the fact that many new motherboards don't even have PS2 ports

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;I wonder how well the PS2 port is emulated by BIOS as regards delays etc.
</I>
I had it working on a real laptop once. But the BIOS thing is a bit of
a problem. I was talking to some guys from Foxconn the other day, and
they were touting how much of their new kit is UEFI...
