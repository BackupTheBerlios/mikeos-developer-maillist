<PRE>Guys, guys! Hold on a second! This is a TSR for drawing interfaces, not a multitasking Windows 1.0 clone! Now if you wanted to implement the multitasking part, you could write it as a standard MikeOS program and do all the PIC timer handling and all that jazz yourself and simply call the Xypher interrupts to draw the interface.

Multitasking...ouch! It's a pain in protected mode, the BIOS doesn't support (I think at least), you'd have to write drivers for a driver...am I over-complicating this? Anyway, a much more durable way of implementing multitasking would be to emulate the system inside of the system (am I talking weird again?) I mean, have a routine that pops that ip (instruction pointer) off the stack, jumps, evaluates x number of instructions on the CPU, then pushes the ip. That way, you could do that routine with two different places in the stack, and simulate minor multitasking...or is this entire method impossible? 

  &gt;Movable windows will most certainly be implemented later, but I don&#8217;t want to cram every feature into version 1.0. I think I will be open-sourcing this, but right now there isn&#8217;t much to see. I&#8217;m still at the &gt;drawing board for the most part.
   

  Already looking forward to this.
   
  I'm not sure how you are doing this, but making it an extention on the kernel might work. That way previously created applications or future ones could opt for a window or go for the non-standard GUI approach.
   
  This may sound stupid but you guys might want to look into REALLY, REALLY simple multitasking using the 1st PIC chip clock (you'll have to look that up). I'm sure most will know that it is a clock hardware interupt. I've seen it done and it works okayish. That way you could have multiple windows on the screen - such as a basic editor and a basic program - VERY COOL.
   
  Maybe that's version 5, 6, maybe 19 ;)
