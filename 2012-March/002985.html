&gt;<i>Hey I am like wooo how did you do that. It actually looks really really neat. The whole window manager idea and mouse support is amazing. Iv been peaking at the TomOS source for mouse support but so &gt;far no cookie. But your OS does indeed look very nifty.
</I>The source code is in there but it's all tangled in FASM (NASM is difficult enough for me without having to untangle FASM) &lt;&lt;At least that's what I remember anyway :) &gt;&gt;. So I snooped around, looked at the old MikeOS project when it had mouse support (which didn't work) and fixed the broken parts with some other code I found on the deep dark web corners. I tend not to comment my code (bad habbits but the comments are in my head), so I'm not sure if it is any good to you for learning. A good OS is not one that has random code slapped together with crossed fingers hoping it will work. Stop and plan. Literally sit there and work out why you want to build an OS, the target audience, who already has one there (you may want to join up with similarly minded people and help them build a better OS than one lone person could ever). Then worry about what it will support, any features it will need to be used easily and finally how it will look. I know I contridict what I have just said with mine - but hey, I was designing the front end first and I made a mistake - so I'm getting round to going back to the beggining again. I realised I didn't fully optimize my code and reqrote it anyway so it was worth it. I now think it may be under to get a GUI OS which would be useable (just) in under 2kb at a push. You need to decide what you are going to do. I am a bit worried at the moment that I may end up talking about my OS too much - as this is afterall a Mike OS mailing list. These guys have their own important work aswell - making sure guys like you and I are able to take up operating system programming in the future with their free, open source, well-commented OS.
