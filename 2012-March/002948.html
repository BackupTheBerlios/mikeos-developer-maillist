<PRE>Mike,

Fabulous - and for me I very much prefer your version - 10.04 - is 
better for me than the &quot;11&quot; version because of the ease to read up the 
way to use it.

Being a computer user since the '70's - PDP8 and PDP11 shows my 
background, not as a programmer but a user.

In 1983 we started the Commodore C64 club and I was President for 9 of 
the 11 years.  Next the Amiga, and the one after that I really enjoyed 
was the HP Integral - this was in the mid 80's - magic.

Then coming through the Microsoft versions I have come across the issues 
that made me look at the two options, Mac and Linux.  I found both 
pretty good, but your support for Linux made me jump ship.

Then joining Linux - the first one I tried was 8.10, but when your 10.04 
came out through the library book - best ever.  To me this shows the 
difference in up grading, the other point is Explorer 8 being more 
important work wise the 9 was not user operating from my day good enough.

Thanks for the book, I purchased one yesterday - helps me out.

Regards,

Peter March

ps my DoB 30-08-45 shows my background and now great interest in Linux.

Peter
