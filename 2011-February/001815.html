<PRE>Hi Raghav,

Indeed, and we've talked about this topic on the list before. There
still doesn't appear to be a simple long-term solution. aeBIOS is a
great intermediate solution for having the benefits of protected mode
without writing native drivers, but because it itself uses the BIOS,
it won't help on UEFI machines.

We could start writing keyboard, screen and floppy disk controller
drivers so that we can ditch the BIOS. (Although with USB keyboards
that gets pretty complex.) We could then bundle them with MikeOS as
some kind of hardware handling library. That might be the only
solution in the long term.

But still, I think MikeOS would lose some of its purity. I like the
idea that anyone can get a good overview of the whole OS workings,
without having to get bogged down in hardware specifics. I like the
fact that's it's a reasonably featureful OS (as opposed to a glorified
boot loader) which people can study and understand, with no need to
worry about poking bytes into the keyboard controller.

I can &quot;see&quot; every byte of MikeOS right now, what it does and how it
works. It all fits together well, I think. Adding a big chunk of
complicated and fussy driver code into the mix will lose that
specialness. But then, I don't know of any other solution!
