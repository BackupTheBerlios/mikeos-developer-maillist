Hi Mike,

I am in no way proposing that your MikeOS project should become PM32. 
Even though I am on a personal crusade against the evils of 16 bit
real mode programming, my personal hobby aeBIOS project finds me
deep in the RM16 BIOS plumbing (it's a smelly job, but some one has to
do it). I actually have to *cough, cough* do some RM16 programming.

&gt;<i> Right now, when you learn how MikeOS works and make modifications, you
</I>&gt;<i> have your code running directly on the bare metal.
</I>
Actually it's running directly on a standard BIOS interface which runs
on the bare metal. aeBIOS has the same interface (onlt PM32).

&gt;<i> You can understand exactly what each part of the OS does -- there's
</I>&gt;<i> just your code and the PC.
</I>
The MikeOs developer (as opposed to the application writter) needs to
understand the BIOS interface which is between the OS and the PC.
aeBIOS is a similar interface between the OS and the PC.

&gt;<i> Adding a layer between that complicates things, and means
</I>&gt;<i> there's something else you have to learn, to get a grand picture of
</I>&gt;<i> everything. It's not quite as &quot;pure&quot; as before.
</I>
The FAT12 supported aeBIOS hides a lot of the PM32 business and allows the
beginner to jump right in just like RM16. Take a look at the translated
PM32 MikeOS and you will find none of the usual PM32 complications.
It should be noted that aeBIOS allows advanced programmers full and
unrestricted access to all PM32 features.

I would like to thank you for not **complaining** about the translated
PM32 MikeOS and the **trouble** that it's causing.
I needed a **most excellent** RM16 example to translate and
**show off** aeBIOS and MikeOS was it.

As brilliant as aeBIOS might be, MikeOS far out shines (aeBIOS is just a
couple of twisted wires in comparison).
