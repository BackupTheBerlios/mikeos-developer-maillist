<PRE>Hi Bazza,

Strange that you found cross-talk problems, I've clocked my parallel port on my 1.7GHz HP laptop
at full tilt and had no problems.
Same as on many computers ranging from P1 200 right up to 2GHz machines.
Are you using output buffers on the port?
What I normally do is use a 74HC245 on the data lines which in turn drives the rest of my external circuit.
If you need even higher current drive and low impedance output get some transistors with a medium to high hfe
at an Ft of at least 500MHz.

Another important thing to remember is keep all the tracks carrying the 8 data lines on your printed circuit board 
all the same length and separated by at least 1.5mm distance and use a track width of at least 0.8mm.
Using 1.6mm double sided FR4 pcb with earth plane on the other side also helps.
This is commonly employed on PCI cards where the parallel data can reach rates in excess of 100MByte/sec.

You can also interleave you data tracks with tracks connected to ground for extra isolation.
This is exactly what is done with the 80 conductor ribbon cable used for PATA hard-drives.

Using bits of hook-up wire is ok to experiment with where most people will use the parallel port at very low speeds.
Are you sure that your problems were not related to &quot;floating&quot; data lines ?
I've found that on some newer pc's the parallel ports don't strictly adhere to TTL logic levels and load capabilities.

What I normally do by default is use pull-up or pull down resistors on all input lines in the region of 4K7 to 10K in value.
Obviously the critieria to select either pull-up or pull-down will depend on your required application.

In conclusion, what I recommend is to leave the delays out of the os call and rather code them in if required.
For small delays, I normally use nop's and for longer delays lasting tens of milliseconds one can use os_pause.

I've often employed the parallel port to bit bang  proprietary serial protocols for customers (running much faster than the 115KB
limit of older serial ports) with no problems whatsoever.

Another project I worked on about a year ago was a parallel port to flashcard interface, and didn't have any of the problems you mentioned.

Regards,
Paulo.
