</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
 It was interesting trying this before. There are two limitations that make
this difficult!
- MikeOS is written using NASM syntax (meaning you would potentually have to
port NASM, not binutils (which uses GAS syntax for it's assembler 'as' and
tends to be easier to port))
- MikeOS only runs in a 64K segment (which isn't enough for both MikeOS and
a native NASM port to run).

This would mean an assembler would pretty much have to be written from
scratch. However, the work being done with some deriative works of MikeOS
toying with the idea of more than one 64K segment opens up the possibility
that they could potentially run a minimal NASM port in future. They'd just
need a cross-compiler to build NASM in the first place to ensure it runs on
your target system and a pretty sophisticated memory manager if they want to
stay in real mode (I'm not sure if NASM keeps under the 1MB limit).
