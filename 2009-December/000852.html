<PRE>Hi Mike,

I've been messing about with the xmodem protocol to create an app for MikeOS
which enables one to transfer compiled programs from a development machine to a stand alone machine running MikeOS.

As you may or may not know, the basic xmodem protocol transmits data in 128 byte packets.

On the one machine I tried it, I got a lot of corrupted data, whilst on the other none at all.
After much hair pulling and liberal use of language that would make Gordon Ramsey blush, I discovered the problem.

The older machine uses the 8250 UART whilst the other uses the newer 16550 UART.
I see that MikeOS sets the UART to 9600pbs with the os_serial_port_enable call to BIOS int14h.

It turns out that the 8250 cannot maintain sustained comms above 1200bps when polled via BIOS int14h, whilst the newer UART will handle up to about 38K.

Whilst this may not be a problem in applications such as a VT100 terminal where only a few ascii characters are sent then followed by large pauses, 
it certainly causes problems when sending &quot;large&quot; amounts of continuous data.

There are two ways to overcome this:

1) Use hardware interrupts which isn't too pleasant.
2) Set up the FIFO buffer present in the UART which is easier but still a pain.

What I did however, is simply to drop the baud rate down to 1200 by adding another os call namely:

os_serial_port_en_slow:

    pusha
    mov dx, 0
    mov al, 10000011b    ; 1200 baud, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit
    mov ah, 0
    int 14h
    popa
    ret


Yes it takes longer to download a program to the MikeOS machine, but even a program
with a size of several KB will only take 2 or so seconds more.

I'm now going to include a &quot;slow-things-down-if-there-are-too-many-errors&quot; option in my program
which let's the user select either low speed (1200 bps) or high speed (9600 bps).

Since you are about to release a newer version of MikeOS, perhaps you would like to include this new call.

Regards,
Paulo.
