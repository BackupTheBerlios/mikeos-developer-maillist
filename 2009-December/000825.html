<PRE>Hi Paulo...

Apologies for any typos...

&gt;<i> Perhaps someone could shed the light on the following:
</I>
&gt;<i> In MikeOS when text mode is called (screen 03h) it's has
</I>&gt;<i> 80x25 characters with 16 colours.
</I>
That is for genuine CGA only, and is technically 640 x 200 giving 8 x 8
characters. This can be character dithered to give more pseudo-colours.

VGA emulates the mode as 720 x 400 and each character is 9 pixels wide
and 16 pixels high.
It is NOT a true representation of CGA as it will NOT dither to give more
pseudo-colours due to the odd pixel width per character.
My old IBM XT had genuine CGA and stuff I wrote for that broke immediately
on my later machines.

This is ancient stuff and is very well documented.

&gt;<i> When graphics mode is used (mode 13h) the screen resolution
</I>&gt;<i> is 320x200 with 256 colours.
</I>
This can be 320 x 400 and was used extensively by Windows in the early
days of VGA(/MCGA) using VESA extensions and using the VGA memory
range, absolute addresses A0000 to BFFFF.

&gt;<i> Yet on my LCD screen, it reports the resolution as 720X400 at 70Hz
</I>&gt;<i> It makes no difference whether the mode is set to text or graphics mode.
</I>&gt;<i> Thinking maybe it was the LCD screen doing some up-scalling or something
</I>&gt;<i> stupid, I connected a CRT monitor, pressed the OSD button and sure enough
</I>&gt;<i> 720X400 at 70Hz.
</I>
It is correct as you are emulating CGA at VGA or greater level.

&gt;<i> Which brings me to my questions:
</I>
&gt;<i> 1) What resolution is mode 03h equivalent to ?
</I>
640 x 200 in text mode but only on genuine CGA cards.
(NOTE:- IBM had an extra mode for its genuine CGA card that could oly be
accessed via special SW that was graphics mode 160 x 200 in 16 colours and
WAS used by some games writers in the early 80s.)
720 x 400 on VGA and above.

This has been consistent for many, many years now.

&gt;<i> 2) Why 720x400, when mode 13h is 320X200 ?
</I>
It is probably emulating the mode internally but you are viewing it as 320 x 200.

&gt;<i> The only thing I can think of is that mode 13h (320x200) was for EGA graphics
</I>&gt;<i> and because I'm using a VGA card, the card automatically does some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> line doubling when this mode is detected.
</I>
True EGA only has the capability of a maximum of 64 FIXED colours as it is digital
much like true CGA however MCGA is analogue much like VGA and above.
(EGA is generally considered 640 x 350 in 16 colours with exactly the same
colours as CGA.)
EGA 640 x 200 16 colours was used extensively by games writers because of
its speed for pixellated DMA.
Tandy graphics mode are similar to EGA low-res modes but with a different set
of video mode values.

Yup, but it is MCGA and cannot be obtained from EGA as that is digital colour only
and MCGA can have a

&gt;<i> Any help would be greatly appreciated.
</I>
