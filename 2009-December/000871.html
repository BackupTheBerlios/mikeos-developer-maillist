<PRE>Xmodem based utility for MikeOS


Xfer.bin is an application to allow the transfer of compiled MikeOS programs
from a development machine to another computer running MikeOS.
Xfer.bin requires a null modem cable connected to the serial ports of both
machines running at 9600 8 N 1 and uses the original Xmodem protocol for the transfer.

The baud rate can also be set to 1200 if preferred.

Although MikeOS can be put onto floppy, cd-rom, USB key or run in a 
virtual machine, to test real hardware it needs to be run on a dedicated computer
or maybe you just want to quickly test your new software masterpiece.

How to use Xfer.bin

On your development machine, write your program you wish to test in the usual way, with one exception:
Set the ORG directive to 36864 instead of the usual 32768.
(The reason being that Xfer.bin is loaded at 32768 and when it downloads your
newly compiled program, it's loaded and run in RAM at 36864).

Now compile your program as usual using NASM.

The address of 36864 was also chosen as MikeOS already uses this address to load
pcx files to view.

Start up Xfer.bin on the MikeOS computer and on the development computer
start up HyperTerminal if you are using Windows or the equivalent in which ever
distro of Linux you happen to be using.

Make sure you set the transmission parameters to 9600bps, 8 bits, no parity and 1 stop bit.
You can alternatively use 1200 baud.

Also ensure you have selected Xmodem with 128 byte packets and checksum and not another
variant of the protocol such as Xmodem1K with CRC.

Ensure that the sending computer is listening and ready to send before selecting option 1 or 2 on Xfer.bin
The transfer to the MikeOS computer will commence.

Once the download is complete, you can run your new program immediately by selecting option 3.
Note however that the newly downloaded program exists only in RAM so if
you reboot or switch off it's gone.

If you're happy with your new program, simply go back to the source on the development
machine and change ORG back to 32768.
Recompile and it can now be included in your next MikeOS image.

Limitations, bugs and improvements.

- The size limit of the program to be downloaded is 16KB.
   Considering that the average size for a MikeOS program (excluding the kernel)
   is around 1KB, if your program is nearing the 16KB limit, it's probably &quot;bloatware&quot; ;-)
   Please note that I have not included any checks for size over-runs.
   If you do, it will over write code and crash and you will have to reboot.

- Speed. 
   At about 1 second/KB, it's not the fastest of transfer apps due to the fact that MikeOS is limited to 9600bps
  and Xmodem is not exactly the most efficient of protocols, but it's easy to code and gets the job done.

Actually most modern serial ports can operate at up to 115K, but that creates a whole new range of problems and pitfalls.

-  Since the transfer is not being done via modems but via a null modem cable, error checking is not really required.
   I've never had a single transfer error as yet.
   If  however you want to add error checking/correction then proceed as follows:

   Store each of the 128 data bytes belonging to a  packet into temp_store
   Save the received checksum byte that follows each packet into header_checksum
   Now add up all of the 128 bytes and save the result.
   Keep subtracting 256 from the result until you get 255 or less.
   Now compare this to the header_checksum saved earlier.
   If they are the same then all the data is OK and proceed to get the next packet by transmitting a ACK to the sending computer.
   If not the same then request the last packet to be re-sent by transmitting a NAK to the sending computer.

The program could also benefit from having a routine that periodically checks for a key press should the sending computer stop
transmitting data &quot;mid-stream&quot; for any reason.
Due to time constraints, I haven't included these features into the program.
It however greatly simplifies the compiling and testing of new programs for MikeOS especially if access to ports is required.
(Normally a problem when running under a Virtual Machine in a non real time OS such as Linux or Windows).
As time permits, I will improve on the program.

- If you find any bugs, then please let me know via the MikeOS mailing list or via email: paulovalongo(-at-)rocketmail.com
or even better, improve on the program and post it back so we can all benefit.

I release Xfer under the same terms and conditions as MikeOS.

Details about serial ports:

Depending on the age of the computer you are using, it will have one of these UART chips for the serial port:

1) 8250 ,very old computer....consider donating to a museum, using as a door stop or boat anchor!!
2) 16550/60, you will still come across these in computers older than about 8 years.
3) 16750, the newer computers use these.

Actually newer computers don't have any of these chips, but instead use a chip called Super I/O
which emulates the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)  amongst other ports.
This also applies to USB to Serial adapters.

The key difference between these chips is the existence and size of a FIFO buffer.
The 8250 only has a 1 byte  buffer while the 16550 has 16 bytes and the 16750 has 64 bytes.

Not having a buffer is OK if you are receiving the occasional ascii character followed by relatively
long pauses in the order of tens of milliseconds such as when emulating a VT100 terminal.
But the situation quickly changes when receiving lots of consecutive bytes such as when using Xmodem
or other protocols.
Over-runs and lost data is guaranteed as the UART has no place to store received data until the program
gets round to retrieving them.

You could always use an interrupt driven routine to alleviate this to a certain extent, but it's an unpleasant task.
Also if you are receiving lots of data, then too many interrupts will be generated which actually becomes counter productive.
So it's always better to stick to a polled based routine unless interrupts are absolutely required.

The FIFO buffer is deactivated by default and must be activated by writing to the appropriate registers.
It is also good practise to clear the buffers of any residual data before using them and disabling the UART generated interrupts.
The standard MikeOS os_serial_port_enable makes no provision for this so I have used direct register access instead (see code).
Also some BIOS' can take up to 200uS to access the UART when using INT 14h which MikeOS relies on for os_get_via_serial.
Again I have used my own routines.

Finally, I have assumed that your computer has either the 16550/650 or 750 UART and have set up the FIFO for 16 bytes.
The 8250 is not supported nor is it tested for.
 

Some Xmodem history:

Xmodem  was invented by Ward Christensen back in the mid-70's as a simple protocol
which would enable almost any type of computer to transfer data using modems connected to telephone lines.

There have been many changes and variants of the original protocol, but the original Xmodem is still
widely used today especially in embedded systems where RAM and CPU power/speed is limited.
Xmodem is perfectly suited to these systems due to it's small CPU demand.

Ward Christensen developed Xmodem on the CP/M system in which all files are multiples of 128 bytes.
The Xmodem protocol carries this particularity.
This means that if you upload a file of say 120 bytes, the remaining 8 bytes will be padded. (normally with 1Ah).
This is not a problem as the last byte of your compiled bin file should be a RET so any data after that is ignored.

Below is the structure of a Xmodem packet:

&lt;SOH&gt;&lt;packet #&gt;&lt;complement of packet #&gt;&lt;128 bytes of actual data&gt;&lt;check sum&gt;

The SOH byte is simply a start of packet marker (01h).
Packet # is the packet number (1 to 255)
Complement of packet # (255 - packet #)
Then follows 128 bytes of actual data
Then a 1 byte checksum.

Total bytes per packet 132.

To get the sending computer to transmit the next packet, the receiving computer sends it a ACK (06h)
To get the sending computer to resend the last packet again, the receiving computer sends it a NAK (15h)
Note that a NAK is also sent to the transmitting computer once at the beginning to initiate a transfer.
If there are no more packets to send, the sending computer sends a EOT (04h) instead of SOH etc.
The receiving computer then responds with a ACK (06h) and the transfer is complete.
