<PRE>I'm writing an operating system in X86 assembly language. Can I get some
help?

I'm a homeschooling teenager, and I've been writing an operating system for
1-3 years. 1 year if you count serious research, 2 years for semiserious
research, 3 years counting time from start of project to now, despite an
eight month break. I've gotten a bit of a hangup on figuring out how to
transport megabytes of information to and from it, though. It's probably
been four months since I started work on it. Judging from how long it took
me to write a bootloader without asking anybody, I figured it was 2-8 months
before I figured this out. Can I get some help on this?

My options as I see it are as follows:
Use Ethernet (comparatively easy to learn bits and pieces of, but knowing
what I'm doing more important, therefore more than random tidbits necessary)
Use USB Flashdrives (Not much information found, but still possible)
Use CDs (Pretty good situation, but even though OSdev has a tutorial on
ATAPI, I still need more information to use)

So, can somebody please help me? I haven't yet found out how to access any
of these options in assembler.

I've already got a working bootloader, by the way, and some basic functions
for keyboard input, and video displays.

Here's the website for my operating system:
