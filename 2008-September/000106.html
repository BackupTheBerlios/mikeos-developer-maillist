<PRE>Hi all,

Thanks for the feedback. I'm currently umming-and-ahhing about having
a four segment design for 2.0:

1) Kernel
2) External program
3) External program extra RAM
4) External program space to load files

If MikeOS handles all this fairly transparently, the user/developer
need not worry too much about segments and offsets -- just accept that
there are four different places to do things. It'll make the OS much
more flexible.

Yeah, it's a dilly of a pickle as Ned Flanders would say. But I think
protected mode is still a no-go area for MikeOS. Ultimately, I'd like
the majority of code to be genuinely useful stuff about OS
construction -- how interrupts work, how a program can interface with
system calls, and so forth.

Right now, there's a chunk of code in MikeOS that's more 'separate'
from this ideal (the FAT12 stuff), and with PM, the amount of code for
handling the keyboard, floppy and screen etc. would just become too
cumbersome. As you say, MikeOS will never be portable in its current
incarnation and I can see why you're heading the PM route -- but for
simplicity's sake I'll stick with real mode for now.

Um, that doesn't make sense, especially if I drop DOS compatibility!
DOS isn't running so we're free to choose nigh-on any interrupt :-)

Yep, GRUB booting in real mode would be tops (as mentioned, I think
there are still far too many downsides in protected mode for a largely
educational project like MikeOS). I haven't looked at interrupt
handling in protected mode but it looks a lot more complex and
involved than in real mode, where you can just poke location into the
interrupt table at the bottom of RAM! Good luck with all the LIDTs and
co. -- sounds like fun :-)

Right now, I think the first thing to consider is hard drive support.
I'm not doing anything with that, but if Ian makes some progress,
that's when an alternative bootloader will have to factor into the
equation.
