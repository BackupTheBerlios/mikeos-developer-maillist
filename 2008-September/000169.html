<PRE>I'm probably as guilty as Troy on that front, so I empathise with his
position. Firstly, I have yet to produce a 0.1 I'm happy with, and second,
my early aims were the following:

- Mouse driver (fail, but I'm doing a bit  of research on that front)
- Mouse-driven GUI (as I failed the above, this would be somewhat difficult)

However, ApolloOS is 32-bit and it is in C, and my CLI (before I felt the
need to delete it accidentally) could handle parentheses and could send an
interrupt (div/0). I also had the beginnings of some user privalages (by
using a global variable called 'perm' (much like the hair style!!!), and
with each command's handler checking 'perm' to see if it matched it's
permission level (0-3) and some CLI commands to allow 'logins' (without
passwords...) and 'logouts', though these were just ways of setting the
'perm' value.

[Feel free to ignore the following part - I go into detail about my
programming experience which would quite happily bore the back teeth off
anyone but myself!).

I'm 17 years old. I wrote my first program aged 15 (which was a web browser
in VB.NET). I've since created a few console apps in C++ (a random number
guessing game and a demo of derived classes and inheritance to name a few)
and recently wrote a VB.NET mobile app as a college project (for orders in a
pizza shop) which was linked to a SQL Server database. I've also had a go at
writing some XNA games in C# (the only game I've made off my own back was a
noughts-and-crosses game, but it's great to play your own games on the XBOX
360!).

I decided to have a go at kernel development as it's something I've never
tried before, and gave me a good excuse to develop something using Linux
tools rather than Visual Studio. Until January this year I didn't even know
it was possible (or an awful lot about operating systems generally). I then
noticed that Mike had mentioned MikeOS in LXF, and on further investigation
really liked the idea. I've gone down the road of 32-bit C as I have some
C++ experience, and like the familiarity. This is the most ambitious project
I've undertaken, and juggling it with my busy lifestyle (two part-time jobs,
a college course, driving lessons and a social life) means it has taken 8
months to get this far, and up until the accidental deletion of my source
code, I was tantalisingly close to releasing something!!! (I remain very,
very gutted about that...)

[Ok, boring part over!!!]

</I>&gt;<i> strange beast :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does batch file stuff count as programming?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kinda -- more like scripting. It teaches some useful principles but is
</I>&gt;<i> still miles away from assembly. For perspective, writing a batch
</I>&gt;<i> script vs writing a TCP/IP stack/C compiler is like assembling a
</I>&gt;<i> doll's house vs designing a nuclear power station.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first teaches you some important stuff about how pieces fit
</I>&gt;<i> together, but you need a gigantic amount of knowledge in many, many
</I>&gt;<i> fields to accomplish the latter. That's what this is all about --
</I>&gt;<i> getting a perspective on things. I'd have a hard time writing a TCP/IP
</I>&gt;<i> stack or C compiler. It's out of the question at your level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You've got to think of what these things entail. This is what you need
</I>&gt;<i> to understand to write a TCP/IP stack:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's INCREDIBLY complicated. That kind of stuff takes months to absorb
</I>&gt;<i> for mere mortals, and that's without the implementation. Same for a C
</I>&gt;<i> compiler -- you need to know about lexical analysis, parsing, the
</I>&gt;<i> inner workings of the x86, and loads of other topics. It's just not
</I>&gt;<i> feasible now Troy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I just want to get a perspective on this, and stop talking about
</I>&gt;<i> stuff that's never going to happen. You have a passion for coding and
</I>&gt;<i> that's brilliant -- but expand yourself realistically. A coin
</I>&gt;<i> collector can't suddenly switch to being head of the world bank.
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, a hobbyist coder who's done some batch scripting and a
</I>&gt;<i> smattering of C/asm can't tackle insanely complex subjects like
</I>&gt;<i> TCP/IP. It's orders of magnitude away. We have to be realistic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I was your age, I was writing games. Simple little affairs, but
</I>&gt;<i> fun to program. Look at gfxdemo.asm for information on switching to
</I>&gt;<i> graphics mode and plotting pixels -- then start playing around. It's
</I>&gt;<i> fun and you might be able to make a mini Snake-like game in a month or
</I>&gt;<i> so. But stay realistic, and don't make grandiose comments before
</I>&gt;<i> you've got code to show :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, enough of this -- I don't want to fill up the mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> with it. Let's focus on the testing for MikeOS 1.9.1!
