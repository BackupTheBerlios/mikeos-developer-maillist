Yep, months after you said you'd write it, and then had nothing to show...

&gt;<i>  So I'm narrowing it down to two things to do: a text editor or my old
</I>&gt;<i>  cross-compiler. Cross-compiler is in the lead.
</I>
Writing a (cross-)compiler is extremely difficult work. You have no
idea because you've never written a big project. I've been programming
for ten years, and I think I'd still need at least six months to get a
rough implementation going.

Your knowledge of assembly is extremely limited (sorry, but it's true
-- if you have to ask how to strip 6 chars off a string then you have
a HUGE amount to learn) so it'd be at least a 12-month job if you
worked hours every night. Are you willing to commit that time? And
accept that you're pretty likely to hit a brick wall early on, simply
through lack of experience?

&gt;<i>  - new mouse code doesn't work with my old Toshiba Satellite laptop.
</I>&gt;<i>  - using FILE.BIN after writing something to the floppy under Windows
</I>&gt;<i>   Vista or XP fails. Might just be me, but I've tried it on two computers.
</I>
Now back to planet Earth :-) This stuff is very useful Troy -- thanks.
For the first bit, I'll pass it on to Tomasz. Could you remind me
please (sorry if I've forgotten) -- are you using a touchpad or PS/2
mouse on the Tosh Sat? Oh, and what's the model number please?

As for the FAT12 stuff, maybe Windows is adding stuff to the root
directory entries to handle long filenames etc., which my code isn't
recognising.
