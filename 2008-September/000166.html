Is that an in-built trackball? I had an old 486 laptop like that --
strange beast :-)

Kinda -- more like scripting. It teaches some useful principles but is
still miles away from assembly. For perspective, writing a batch
script vs writing a TCP/IP stack/C compiler is like assembling a
doll's house vs designing a nuclear power station.

The first teaches you some important stuff about how pieces fit
together, but you need a gigantic amount of knowledge in many, many
fields to accomplish the latter. That's what this is all about --
getting a perspective on things. I'd have a hard time writing a TCP/IP
stack or C compiler. It's out of the question at your level.

You've got to think of what these things entail. This is what you need
to understand to write a TCP/IP stack:

<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc793.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc793.html</A>

It's INCREDIBLY complicated. That kind of stuff takes months to absorb
for mere mortals, and that's without the implementation. Same for a C
compiler -- you need to know about lexical analysis, parsing, the
inner workings of the x86, and loads of other topics. It's just not
feasible now Troy.

So I just want to get a perspective on this, and stop talking about
stuff that's never going to happen. You have a passion for coding and
that's brilliant -- but expand yourself realistically. A coin
collector can't suddenly switch to being head of the world bank.
Similarly, a hobbyist coder who's done some batch scripting and a
smattering of C/asm can't tackle insanely complex subjects like
TCP/IP. It's orders of magnitude away. We have to be realistic.

When I was your age, I was writing games. Simple little affairs, but
fun to program. Look at gfxdemo.asm for information on switching to
graphics mode and plotting pixels -- then start playing around. It's
fun and you might be able to make a mini Snake-like game in a month or
so. But stay realistic, and don't make grandiose comments before
you've got code to show :-)

Anyway, enough of this -- I don't want to fill up the mailing list
with it. Let's focus on the testing for MikeOS 1.9.1!
