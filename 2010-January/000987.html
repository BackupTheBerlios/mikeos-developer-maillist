<PRE>Hi Mike,

As you know I'm busy looking at writing some software
for MikeOS for the IrDA port due to the lack of any other ports on modern computers.

I've been looking around in my spare time at the latest offerings of all the PC manufactures
and I have to say that I'm quite despondent at the lack of all ports except for USB.
The question I have is:

Why are manufactures no longer including serial and parallel ports on the latest computers?
Is it due to cost? (I doubt it.)
Or is it because the connectors are too big for the &quot;micro&quot; machines of today ?
If this is the case,  why not  create a new type of  connector,
loosely based on the mini-USB type or even a mini version of the HDMI connector ?

These would be much smaller  and thus more in keeping with the ultra thin and small 
laptops and notebooks of today.

Adaptors could then be used which would convert back to the normal connectors used in legacy ports 
(i.e. DB-25 and Centronics for the parallel port and DB-9 for the serial port  see figs 3 and 4).

For the parallel port, the new mini connector would only require 18 pins.
The original DB-25 connector has  ground on pins 18 to 25.
Since the parallel port is a low current type port, the extra ground pins serve no purpose.
The rest of the pins would carry the same signals as before.(see fig 1)

For the serial port, a similar arrangement could be used but the connector would 
only have 10pins.(see fig 2)

In this way it would be impossible for someone to incorrectly insert a new type parallel port
connector to a serial port and vice-versa.
As a standard serial port only requires 9 connections, the tenth one could be left unconnected 
or used as an extra ground pin.
Again an adaptor cable could be used to connect to equipment which has the traditional DB-9 type connector.

Serial and parallel ports are still being used for printers, GSM modems,  
industrial machinery and other manufacturing equipment such as CNC machines, engravers, etc.

Also, many companies and private individuals still use software which directly communicates with the ports and 
in this case USB to serial or parallel converters cannot be used as they are &quot;mapped&quot; to ports numbers above 
which these software applications can access.

The dominant operating systems on the market today are still XP and Linux.
Contrary to popular belief, both of these O.S.&#8217;s do allow direct access to ports with the usage of an 
appropriate library (dll) in the case of Windows and the setting of permissions on Linux.

These new types of connectors could be incorporated quite easily and cheaply into a selected range of laptops and notebooks 
which would cater for these markets.
After all these ports have served us well for more than 20 years, 
so why discontinue them when in reality they only cost a $1 or two to include.
USB is not the answer to everything.

Paulo.
