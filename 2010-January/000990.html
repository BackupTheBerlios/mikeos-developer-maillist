<PRE>Hi Bazza,

What I meant by direct port access is that it does not have to be done via the kernel
as is the case with windows.
In windows, the LPT is &quot;owned&quot; by the kernel which in turn hands exclusive control
to the print spooler service.
However this is easy to turn off and with the aid of a dll running in Ring 0,  &quot;direct&quot;
port access is possible.

As far as IrDA is concerned, it's actually easier then you might imagine.
Remember that the fancy protocols used by IrDA are only required when the port
is being used at very fast speeds of 4MB/s
At lower speeds (i.e 9600) raw access is perfectly acceptable and the physical layer
has many similaraties to a standard serial port hence loads of memory and coding is not
required to simulate a good old fashioned com port.

I have played around with using different segments by loading them into the ES and DS regs
with no problems what so ever.
Just watch what you do with CS.

Be more optimistic Bazza....remember what you said about USB keyboards ?

Paulo.

Hi Paulo...

&gt;<i> As you know I'm busy looking at writing some software for MikeOS for
</I>&gt;<i> the IrDA port due to the lack of any other ports on modern computers.
</I>
Good luck matey, remember you only have 32KB user-mem to play with
unless you intend to breakout into the other parts of the 640KB base memory...
Not sure how MikeOS will behave when shifting all the segments around too.

&gt;<i> I've been looking around in my spare time at the latest offerings of all the
</I>&gt;<i> PC manufactures and I have to say that I'm quite despondent at the lack
</I>&gt;<i> of all ports except for USB.
</I>
Me too... :(

&gt;<i> The question I have is:
</I>
&gt;<i> Why are manufactures no longer including serial and parallel ports on the
</I>&gt;<i> latest computers?
</I>
The answer is simple, they are no longer needed in this digital convergence
world that we live in where even your ass is wiped in a public convenience.

&gt;<i> Is it due to cost? (I doubt it.)
</I>
Many desktop mobos have the facility although maybe not enabled and requiring
the socket to be retro-fitted, and if not, slot in cards are still available.

&gt;<i> Or is it because the connectors are too big for the &quot;micro&quot; machines of today ?
</I>
For lightweight portables, yes.

&gt;<i> If this is the case,  why not  create a new type of  connector,
</I>
Eh! 
&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> The dominant operating systems on the market today are still XP and Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> Contrary to popular belief, both of these O.S.&#8217;s do allow direct access to ports
</I>&gt;<i> with the usage of an appropriate library (dll) in the case of Windows and the
</I>&gt;<i> setting of permissions on Linux.
</I>
This statement is nonesense, it`s either direct or indirect. If a library is required
then it is not direct by definition. MikeOS already has the ability of direct eccess
to legacy items even from its BASIC interpreter now.

&gt;<i> These new types of connectors could be incorporated quite easily and cheaply
</I>&gt;<i> into a selected range of laptops and notebooks which would cater for these
</I>&gt;<i> markets.
</I>
Curiosity has gotten the better of me here.
How would you impose your will and get these ports accepted when Intel, MS
and other huge corporations have the monopoly???

&gt;<i> After all these ports have served us well for more than 20 years, 
</I>&gt;<i> so why discontinue them when in reality they only cost a $1 or two to include.
</I>
My sentiments exactly...

&gt;<i> USB is not the answer to everything.
</I>
As is proven when using my approach in getting a DC value into ANY computer.
With bloat-OSes this is pi$$ easy but in a restricted environment the whole
angle of attack to the problem changes or becomes impossible...
