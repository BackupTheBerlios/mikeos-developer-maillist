<PRE>Thanks for the links Mike.

Although after reading them, it's still clear as mud to me.
I did however manage to pick up a few bits of important information:

1) If the BIOS does indeed mess with the segment registers, it would be
   completely dependent on each individual call.
  Although I'm not convinced it will happen at all.

2) I quite like the idea of making a subroutine which one would call with 32 bit code
    which would then make the BIOS call for us.

3) Enabling the A20 line is much easier than I thought so I'm going to start using it
    in Real mode for now.
    Every bit of extra available memory helps.
    It just bugs me that I can only use 640KB maximum.(I'm used to coding in a 32 bit environment
    where memory is ample and cheap).

4) Going to investigate Unreal mode for myself to see what happens.

One of the main reasons I would like access to ooodles of RAM is so when MikeOS boots, the kernel first
loads a whole stack of binaries at different locations in RAM.
When we need to run them they are simply fetched from RAM, placed at start location 32768 of segment 2000h and executed from there.
The nice thing about this is that all the ORG's can stay the same.

Much quicker then running them from floppy/CD each time.

Paulo.

Hi Paulo,

Here's the OSDev.org discussion about unreal mode. My concerns were
triggered by Firestryke31's post in the middle of the second page --
the discussion following it is very interesting:

<A HREF="http://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=21179">http://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=21179</A>

Some people think BIOS interrupts could mess around with segment
registers, whereas others say it's not possible. So I have no idea :-)
