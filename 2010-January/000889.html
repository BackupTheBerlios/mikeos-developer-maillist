<PRE>Hi Paulo

&gt;<i> Mike, have you ever considered using unreal mode for MikeOS?
</I>&gt;<i> Since most computers these days (and even of several years ago) probably
</I>&gt;<i> have at least 128MB of RAM or more, it seems a shame to be limited to 640KB
</I>&gt;<i> and the horrible sector:offset arrangement with all those overlapping segments.
</I>
&lt;snip&gt;

It defeats the object of &quot;16 bit OS&quot;!

I for one would not be interested as I love working inside VERY restricted
&quot;environments&quot;.

It would put me off completely as I can do just about everything I want using
Linux, Windows PCs and AMIGAs already in various languages...

Already uploaded a DEMO spot frequency Audio Function Generator to LXF
using a STANDARD Python 2.5.2 for Linux install, by &quot;banging the metal&quot;.
It generates SINE, SQUARE, TRIANGLE, SAWTOOTH+, SAWTOOTH-, PULSE+
and PULSE- waveforms at 1KHz out of the earphone socket...

Everything therefore becomes easy...

Even down to getting DC into Netbooks.

Try getting DC into current Netbooks using 16 bit MikeOS... :-O

If anybody can solve that SOAB then they are a better man than I.

Also sooner or later we will be back to &quot;.OVL&quot; type files inside our 32KB
of memory space...

There IS a potential 28KB maximum extra storage space in the upper
pages of the CGA memory area of which I have been looking at 16KB for
an 8 Channel Logic Analyser...

While I`m on this reply, Mike et al I have worked out how to display an
analogue real time Bar Graph Meter using CGA text mode 3 graphics to 7 and 8
bit depth using MIKE-BASIC. I will be posting it on here in the near future...

I`m wondering if 10 bit depth is possible to for full Arduino spec` per ADC... ;-)
