<PRE>Hi Mike,

Interesting points.

I wonder to what extent AMD chips are compatible with Intel's.
I wonder if one can still have unreal mode on them.

Can you remember where you read about some BIOS chips having a problem with unreal mode?
I would like to investigate further, as I can't see how the BIOS can be &quot;aware&quot; of what mode the cpu is in.
As long as you call the BIOS int's with 16 bit code.

As regards a MikeOS version for &quot;stone age&quot; cpu's :-) that ain't a bad idea having a separate version for these.
Although as you pointed out, I can't see a vaiable option to pusha.
Perhaps this way....

mov ax, bx
mov [variable_one], ax

mov ax, cx
mov [variable_two], ax

etc etc

variable_one   dw    0
varaible_two   dw    0

Paulo.

Hi Paulo,

&gt;<i> Mike, have you ever considered using unreal mode for MikeOS?
</I>
Yes, I did think about this a while ago. It's a very interesting
subject! Clearly unreal mode is very useful for the reasons you
mentioned, but there were three things that put me off (although I may
be wrong on them):

1) I wasn't sure how well this was supported by BIOSes and
x86-compatible CPUs. I'd really like MikeOS to work on as much generic
hardware as possible.

2) I read somewhere that certain BIOSes don't expect calls to be made
from unreal mode, and can therefore faff with segments and put you
back into real-real mode. Someone suggested re-enabling unreal mode
after every BIOS interrupt which seems pretty messy.

3) As you said, while it lets us wallow in RAM for data purposes,
we're still limited to 64K so there'd still be a 32k kernel / 32k app
split as there is now. Given the limitations of the OS I can't
envisage any application that needs so much memory.

All that said, unreal mode MikeOS wouldn't be hard to make -- just a
few tweaks here and there -- so if anyone wants to give it a go and
test it on some real hardware, that'd be great! If it works like a
charm and my concerns above don't turn out to be real then yes, maybe
that could be the future for MikeOS...

Cheers!

M
