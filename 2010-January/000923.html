<PRE>Hi Bazza,

I guess not all pc's/netbooks/laptops have IrDA, but like you said it's another doorway.
Have you tried a USB keyboard ?
Since a keyboard is part of the HID class, I suspect that BIOS has support for it and should work
straight &quot;out the box&quot;.
If this is so, then you could always &quot;hack&quot; the keyboard and connect your inputs to certain keys
via adequate isolation and presto, crude input port.
If you needed output then you could always write to the keyboard controller to switch on and off the CAPS LOCK and NUM LOCK leds.
This could emulate the serial clock and chip select for your ADC chips.

Paulo.

Hi Paulo...

&gt;<i> For example, myself and Bazza were discussing a few things off line yesterday
</I>&gt;<i> and he posed a very interesting question, how does one get real world data in
</I>&gt;<i> and out of a new netbook/laptop which has only USB with MikeOS?
</I>
&gt;<i> I've never really given this much thought as normally I would just use USB or
</I>&gt;<i> even Ethernet and problem solved, but on MikeOS this would be unfeasible.
</I>
&gt;<i> So after some head scratching I think I've come up with a solution....IrDA!!
</I>&gt;<i> For those who don't know, Irda is a bi-directional infra-red port found on
</I>&gt;<i> many laptops, netbooks and smartphones.
</I>&gt;<i> On PC's, it can be enabled in BIOS by mapping COM2 to the IrDA port.
</I>
Nice idea matey, except BEWARE!...

This HP notebook does NOT have IrDA facilities at BIOS level.
My HP laptop doesn`t either.

My quad core desktop does but my other older P IV doesn`t.

So this does not fill my criteria for ALL current home computing machines.

However it would give another doorway for some machines... :)

&gt;<i> So I have decided to look further into this and make a IrDA interface for MikeOS.
</I>&gt;<i> Will keep you posted.
</I>
I`m still looking for a universal method...

I was thinking of the possibility of hacking a USB Floppy drive, but they will soon
become as rare as rocking horse sh1t, and I suspect it would it be impossible
to force it to do external data I/O, AND, normal I/O anyhow.
