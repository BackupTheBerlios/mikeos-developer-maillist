<PRE>Bazza,

I suspect the reason your keyboard code from the 8088 days does not work any more
is due to the fact that they used XT keyboards where as the new ones are PS/2 as you know.
I have no idea which ports were used for the XT and what the protocol was, but
with PS/2 all is done via ports 60h and 64h.

As far as IrDA is concerned, like you say it's not a very popular port but a lot of desktop mobo's
do have the port but just need the infra-red transceiver to be plugged in.
Luckily both my laptops do have IrDA so I will use the one with XP and the other for MikeOS.

Will keep you posted.

Paulo.

Hi Paulo...

&gt;<i> As far as IrDA is concerned, it's actually easier then you might imagine.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that the fancy protocols used by IrDA are only required when
</I>&gt;<i> the port is being used at very fast speeds of 4MB/s
</I>&gt;<i> At lower speeds (i.e 9600) raw access is perfectly acceptable and the
</I>&gt;<i> physical layer has many similaraties to a standard serial port hence loads
</I>&gt;<i> of memory and coding is not required to simulate a good old fashioned
</I>&gt;<i> com port.
</I>
I wish you well with it, and if successful I may use it. I never looked into
it because it is not common enough for my needs as yet. 3 out of 4 of
my machines have not got IrDA so I haven`t pursued it with any vigour.

&gt;<i> I have played around with using different segments by loading them
</I>&gt;<i> into the ES and DS regs with no problems what so ever.
</I>&gt;<i> Just watch what you do with CS.
</I>
CS, (and SS), were the ones I was thinking of. I have already used ES
in the TESTCARD proggy, I know that that causes no problems...

&gt;<i> Be more optimistic Bazza....remember what you said about USB keyboards ?
</I>
;o)

(The KBs arrived yesterday at work, not had time to strip them yet.)

Don`t get me on that, I wrote a simple Caps Lock and CLS SW arround 20
years ago when I was learning 8088 assembly. This has worked on everything
I used it on but guess what?

Well it doesn`t work correctly on current machines even in MikeOS... :/

Not really a problem but why oh why do &quot;manufacturers&quot; change things that
have worked well enough for decades... :(
