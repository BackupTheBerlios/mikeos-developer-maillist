<PRE>Hi Bazza,

&gt;<i> I wrote a simple Caps Lock and CLS SW arround 20
</I>&gt;<i> years ago when I was learning 8088 assembly. This has worked on everything
</I>&gt;<i> I used it on but guess what?
</I>&gt;<i> Well it doesn`t work correctly on current machines even in MikeOS... :/
</I>
Here is some info that might help:

================================================
IBM PC/XT keyboard (1981)
================================================

83 keys
5 pin din connector
Simple uni-directional serial protocol
Uses scan code 1
No host to kb commands

=================================================
IBM AT keyboard (1984) Not backward compatible with XT systems
=================================================

84 - 101 keys
5 pin din connector
Bi-directional serial protocol
Uses scan code 2
8 host to kb commands

=================================================
IBM PS/2 keyboard (1987) compatible with AT but not XT
=================================================

84 - 101 keys
6 pin mini-din connector
Bi-directional serial protocol
Uses scan code 3 (but only scan code 2 is guaranteed for all manufactures)
17 host to kb commands (Acknowledges all commands but may not act on all).

Like I said in my previous post, you can control the PS/2 kb (including the LED's)
via ports 60h and 64h.

Paulo.

Hi Paulo...

&gt;<i> As far as IrDA is concerned, it's actually easier then you might imagine.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that the fancy protocols used by IrDA are only required when
</I>&gt;<i> the port is being used at very fast speeds of 4MB/s
</I>&gt;<i> At lower speeds (i.e 9600) raw access is perfectly acceptable and the
</I>&gt;<i> physical layer has many similaraties to a standard serial port hence loads
</I>&gt;<i> of memory and coding is not required to simulate a good old fashioned
</I>&gt;<i> com port.
</I>
I wish you well with it, and if successful I may use it. I never looked into
it because it is not common enough for my needs as yet. 3 out of 4 of
my machines have not got IrDA so I haven`t pursued it with any vigour.

&gt;<i> I have played around with using different segments by loading them
</I>&gt;<i> into the ES and DS regs with no problems what so ever.
</I>&gt;<i> Just watch what you do with CS.
</I>
CS, (and SS), were the ones I was thinking of. I have already used ES
in the TESTCARD proggy, I know that that causes no problems...

&gt;<i> Be more optimistic Bazza....remember what you said about USB keyboards ?
</I>
;o)

(The KBs arrived yesterday at work, not had time to strip them yet.)

Don`t get me on that, I wrote a simple Caps Lock and CLS SW arround 20
years ago when I was learning 8088 assembly. This has worked on everything
I used it on but guess what?

Well it doesn`t work correctly on current machines even in MikeOS... :/

Not really a problem but why oh why do &quot;manufacturers&quot; change things that
have worked well enough for decades... :(
