<PRE>Hi Dan,

&gt;<i> Just a little question, you know when Mike OS loads the kernel into RAM, it
</I>&gt;<i> preserves enough space for how big it is&#8230;.
</I>
That's not actually what happens: the first 32K of the 64K segment is
allocated to the kernel, regardless of its size. Currently the MikeOS
kernel assembles to around a 13K binary, so there's plenty of space
left.

&gt;<i> Well what would I have to change
</I>&gt;<i> to make it so that the Kernel only has 1kb, and the applications are given
</I>&gt;<i> the rest of the RAM, (excluding the buffer).
</I>
That entirely depends on the design of your OS. If it's like MikeOS,
you simply begin loading programs at kernel size+8K buffer point. Of
course, your programs will need to be ORGed to a certain point, and if
your kernel grows your programs will stop working, hence why it's best
to give the kernel plenty of room.

If your OS is going to be very small, give 8K for the kernel and 8K
for the buffer, so programs can begin loading at the 16K mark and
therefore have the remaining 48K of the segment to play with.

&gt;<i> As another add on, I am also trying to figure out how to use the mouse in 16
</I>&gt;<i> bit, so has anyone got any idea how I can use the bios to do this
</I>
Unfortunately you can't use the BIOS solely to operate the mouse.
There are some initialisation things as you mentioned, but ultimately
you have to read and write bytes to the keyboard controller to handle
PS/2 mice. (USB mice in protected mode require a USB stack, but in
real mode the PC should emulate them as PS/2.)

Ages ago I wrote a mouse driver based on these two sources:

<A HREF="http://wiki.osdev.org/Mouse_Input">http://wiki.osdev.org/Mouse_Input</A>
<A HREF="http://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10247">http://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10247</A>

That has all the info you need. The latter can be converted into asm
pretty easily. Also, see TomOS, a MikeOS spin-off project that
includes a mouse driver:

Good luck!
