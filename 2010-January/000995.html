<PRE>Hi Paulo...

&gt;<i> As far as IrDA is concerned, it's actually easier then you might imagine.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that the fancy protocols used by IrDA are only required when
</I>&gt;<i> the port is being used at very fast speeds of 4MB/s
</I>&gt;<i> At lower speeds (i.e 9600) raw access is perfectly acceptable and the
</I>&gt;<i> physical layer has many similaraties to a standard serial port hence loads
</I>&gt;<i> of memory and coding is not required to simulate a good old fashioned
</I>&gt;<i> com port.
</I>
I wish you well with it, and if successful I may use it. I never looked into
it because it is not common enough for my needs as yet. 3 out of 4 of
my machines have not got IrDA so I haven`t pursued it with any vigour.

&gt;<i> I have played around with using different segments by loading them
</I>&gt;<i> into the ES and DS regs with no problems what so ever.
</I>&gt;<i> Just watch what you do with CS.
</I>
CS, (and SS), were the ones I was thinking of. I have already used ES
in the TESTCARD proggy, I know that that causes no problems...

&gt;<i> Be more optimistic Bazza....remember what you said about USB keyboards ?
</I>
;o)

(The KBs arrived yesterday at work, not had time to strip them yet.)

Don`t get me on that, I wrote a simple Caps Lock and CLS SW arround 20
years ago when I was learning 8088 assembly. This has worked on everything
I used it on but guess what?

Well it doesn`t work correctly on current machines even in MikeOS... :/

Not really a problem but why oh why do &quot;manufacturers&quot; change things that
have worked well enough for decades... :(
