<PRE>Hi Mike,

An idea which uses linux and the concept of MikeOS rolled into one.

How about getting/making a small distro with none of the big apps such as Xwindows, OpenOffice, FF,etc
and modified to boot directly into a fullscreen terminal session.

The idea being that using a &quot;easy&quot; text editor like PICO (not great but certainly easier than Vi), 
one could type in assembly code and compile it with NASM which would be included.
Not only would this make it easier to introduce linux to new users (myself included) but would also teach assembly language
in a similar fashion to MikeOS but instead of making use of Bios calls, the calls would be to INT 80h.
For example:  <A HREF="http://asm.sourceforge.net/articles/audio.html">http://asm.sourceforge.net/articles/audio.html</A> 
and a list of the calls here:  <A HREF="http://docs.cs.up.ac.za/programming/asm/derick_tut/syscalls.html">http://docs.cs.up.ac.za/programming/asm/derick_tut/syscalls.html</A>

Since the kernel would contain many of the drivers and the ability to refer to all the .h files, it would overcome
many of the shortcomings of MikeOS such as playing sound, higher video resolutions, http/ftp stack etc

Lots of documentation like you have with MikeOS would also help, like for example saving a newly compiled program/s and making them
run at boot up etc.

See <A HREF="http://asm.sourceforge.net/">http://asm.sourceforge.net/</A>  and  <A HREF="http://docs.cs.up.ac.za/programming/asm/derick_tut/">http://docs.cs.up.ac.za/programming/asm/derick_tut/</A>

As with MikeOS, you could make available the iso with instructions on how to run it live or install it to a hard-drive or
even onto a USB flash/pen drive.

Perhaps you could even get LXF to actively promote it and run regular features on it.
I certainly don't have the knowledge to get something like this going but would certainly use it as I'm sure many others would too.

Paulo.
