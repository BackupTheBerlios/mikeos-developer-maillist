In MikeOS 2.0 I had a couple of system calls to modify the interrupt
table -- os_get_int_handler and os_modify_int_handler IIRC. They were
primarily used to implement DOS int 21h support -- but after I removed
the DOS code for 3.0 I removed those too. You might be able to get
something from them.

&gt;<i> Currently I'm just coding, hoping it will mean something eventually :P
</I>
That's just how I started with this -- I was just coding for fun!
After a bit I thought the code may be useful to others, and then
people started getting involved, and here we are. So it's always worth
cracking on, as it means you're always learning new stuff, providing
you enjoy it!

&gt;<i>  Finally, if it's OK with you, I think I'm going to have to start
</I>&gt;<i>  copying code/concepts from MikeOS v2/3 as I can't seem to make some
</I>&gt;<i>  things work anymore. All the necessary copyright will be kept.
</I>
Naturally, take as much as you want -- that's always been my goal,
making MikeOS a source of code for new OS development. Any questions
about it, you know where to ask :-)
