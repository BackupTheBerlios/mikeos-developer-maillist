<PRE>COS (the OS/Kernel) and BUT (the CLI) have now reached a point of
stability where I feel I can share them. There isn't much implemented
in BUT, but the idea is all there. Play around with it, and try and
break it - then let me know :) Type help for the commands.

The idea is that, eventually, COS and BUT will be totally separate,
with COS scanning the media for anything tagged .ui and then
presenting a list of the UI's available, and running one. Each CLI
will be, in it's own right, a separate programme - allowing you to
interface with the OS as you wish. I plan to trivially extend this to
a DOS compliant (like MikeOS v1.xx) cli and something entirely
different.

The source is has been packaged with the disk image. Mike: Take a look
at the k_str_split, k_str_divs and k_str_copy (no need for concat)
procedures and take what you like from there. Any
suggestions/complaints are welcome.

Enjoy

Tslil

PS: Apologies about last time, and the 1.xx mb attachment, as well as
the fact that the message is exactly the same as previously, but I
think it about sums it up well - plus I'm a tad lazy.

PPS: Changed the file ext. just in case gmail tried to pull a fast one
