<PRE>&gt;<i> Nice work; good comments too -- I'll try out the latest code and
</I>&gt;<i> replace the current os_int_to_string implementation with it providing
</I>&gt;<i> everything's OK. Thanks for the help!
</I>
Thank you, and it's a pleasure. Let me know if the chopl/r/a makes it,
I'd be interested to see how that one gets implemented

&gt;<i> Yep, simplicity is the overriding goal, but I still want to have a
</I>&gt;<i> good API to encourage more external program development. MikeOS is
</I>&gt;<i> working in a limited environment with only 64K to play around with (as
</I>&gt;<i> I want to avoid segment register horrors), but given that the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> is only around 7K right now, there's loads of space for more system
</I>&gt;<i> calls.
</I>
Heh, there's always room ;) Though I can definitely say I know where
you're coming from

&gt;<i> So please feel free to keep submitting code -- if it's right for
</I>&gt;<i> MikeOS I'll use it, or I'll take it as inspiration for more ideas! My
</I>&gt;<i> goal has been to replicate as many features of a typical C library as
</I>&gt;<i> possible (within the goals and constraints of MikeOS), thereby making
</I>&gt;<i> it easier to write apps. So more system calls are definitely welcome
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>
Roger that, will keep scratching about

&gt;<i> You mentioned working on a kernel -- how's that going? I assume it's
</I>&gt;<i> also 16-bit and at least primarily in assembly?
</I>
Heh, I'll say it could be going better. I've got 80% of what I would
seem to need for a cli-only OS and kernel done and ready, though NASM
seems to be hating my bootloader and main kernel proc. It is purely
16bit asm, and that's probably how it's going to stay. If I include
some string handling to assemble, it refuses to run, even though it's
not called. I'm struggling with my own take on setting up the IVT,
but, with perseverance, it should all work out. I'm not sure whether
you went through the same problem as I face now, but I lack an aim.
Currently I'm just coding, hoping it will mean something eventually :P

Finally, if it's OK with you, I think I'm going to have to start
copying code/concepts from MikeOS v2/3 as I can't seem to make some
things work anymore. All the necessary copyright will be kept.
