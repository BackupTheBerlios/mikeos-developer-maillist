<PRE>First off, congratulations on your 3.2 release! Well done, and wow,
looking at the 1.xx releases, you certainly have come a long a way :)

Secondly, I am honoured that you included my name in the list of
developers - thank you!

Finally, on topic, I recently had this little struggle with my own
kernel. I eventully decided in favour of creating a new command to
assign a temporary buffer to a procedure. I took this decision for
three main reasons:

-The size bonus (where minimalism is fun and a good challenge :P )
-It easily allows for future Memory Managers or Psuedo-MM's to be
inplement as the code is already being allocated memory in a vague
kind of map
-For whatever conceivable reason, you can theoreticlly transfer entire
memory buffers to and from various procedures

It is quite a radical jump and is now top priority as modifying the
structure of the entire system is anything but trivial. Personally,
with a kernel as advanced as that of MikeOS, I would implement the
necesasry syscalls for memory mapping and then slowly ween the kernel
of internal memory use.

Just my two cents,

Tslil

PS: I see no reaon why not to fork the kernel, one frozen at 3.2 with
the old memory buffers and one, say, M.3.2 which will be devloped with
the psuedo-memory allocation.
