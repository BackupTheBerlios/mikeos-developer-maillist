<PRE>Hi everyone,

I've released MikeOS 2.9.2, the first step on the road to 3.0:

<A HREF="http://download.berlios.de/mikeos/mikeos-2.9.2.tar.gz">http://download.berlios.de/mikeos/mikeos-2.9.2.tar.gz</A>

(I'd already released 2.9.01 when testing out unreal mode, hence the
version number here!) There are a lot of changes to simplify the
source code and some things have been removed:

# DOS support -- this was a great feature, but it was very limited.
Now that MikeOS is always going to stay in a 64K segment, it means
that few programs would ever be able to run, so it makes sense to cut
it

# Mouse support -- Tomasz has done some brilliant work, but I simply
don't fully understand the code because I know little about the PS/2
protocol. In order to document MikeOS as best as possible, I need to
understand the whole codebase completely

Of course, these features will live on and improve in TomOS! But for
the simplicity approach of MikeOS, I think it's best to cut them out.

Additionally, the MikeOS memory map has changed. Here's the new layout
of the 64K segment:

- 24K for kernel
- 8K for disk operations
- 32K for external programs

This simplifies the kernel in that the system call vectors start from
0, and we don't have to jump over a blank 32K of code at the
beginning. And if you think 24K is too limiting for the kernel,
currently it assembles to a mere 6.8K binary, and that's with 50+
system calls. So there's still a relatively huge amount of room for
new system calls and features.

The source code has been split up into individual files for the
different features: command line, screen handling, serial port and so
forth. There's still more to be done here; I need to split out the
FAT12 handling code from syscalls.asm.

The full changelog is pasted at the bottom of this mail. In summary,
MikeOS is now a lot simpler in terms of features, design and source
code structure, making it a lot easier to work with! There's still a
few things to do, and I need to go about splitting up the
documentation into files for users, OS developers and app developers.

Cheers,
Mike


# Major code simplification and cleanup: removed mouse support, DOS
support, STAKAN.BIN, testzone, CLI PROMPT command

# Memory map shuffled: first 24K is kernel code space; then 8K buffer
for kernel disk operations; then 32K for external programs

# Source code restructured: bootloader moved to source/bootload;
system calls now separated into multiple files in source/features;
os_main.asm renamed kernel.asm; kernel file is now KERNEL.BIN

# When exiting a program that was launched from the menu-driven app
selector, the &quot;Program finished&quot; message now appears in a red bar at
the bottom

# os_get_file_list now returns sanitised comma-separated list of files
(eg &quot;FOO.BIN,HELLO.TXT&quot; instead of &quot;FOO     BIN,HELLO   TXT&quot; etc.)

# os_list_dialog rewritten: now shows selected option as a black bar,
rather than with &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;
