<PRE>Hi Paul,

&gt;<i> Nope ain't the same Paul Sommers.
</I>
I think Bob's brain had context switched for a second -- there wasn't
a Paul at the meeting he mentioned. There was another guy from SA
though so I think that's where the mixup came from :-)

&gt;<i> I quite like the idea of introducing &quot;how to&quot; guides for developers
</I>&gt;<i> wishing to put back some of the features taken out of MikeOS.
</I>
I really like this idea. Ultimately the biggest strength in MikeOS
will (hopefully!) be in the documentation and code structure: the
source layout, the comments, and the accompanying Handbooks. We need
to maintain a balance between keeping the core simple, yet providing
enough features that it's a good start for extending.

I'd love to have a set of tutorials on the website for 3.0, showing
how to add more functionality like the basic DOS compatibility that
was removed in 2.9. Anyone is welcome to write docs!

But having DOS compatibility as a permanent feature of the OS is
tricky. It worked OK for some tiny .COM games in 2.0, but the MikeOS
memory map (everything in one 64K segment) means that the vast
majority of programs would never be able to run, even if we
implemented more int 21h routines. Most .COM apps assume they have
full control of the 64K segment.

So the only real choice was to cut out the rudimentary DOS support and
simplify the OS, or extend it and have to deal with segments. For
those who've dealt with segments before, it's not the most complex
thing in the world, but it's pretty painful for new OS developers and
adds a lot to the code. So IMHO we're best off with the simplicity
approach even though it does lose us a feature.

That said, DOS compatibility will no doubt continue with TomOS, the
feature-laden spin-off of MikeOS. I've heard from Tom and he hopes to
get a release out in the new year, and he's working on some cool
stuff.

&gt;<i> What I would really like to see is FAT16 support for MikeOS, although I
</I>&gt;<i> understand the extra complexity it would add.
</I>
That'd be fantastic. I think it's an enhancement that could be
introduced into the current FAT12 code without any drastic changes to
the OS design, so if anyone wants to write it that'd be great.

M
