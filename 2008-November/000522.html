Alright, I'll fess up: TomOS will run Mac OS X apps with 100%
compatibility at twice the speed, make your hard drive spin 4x faster,
and shrink a 17&quot; gaming laptop into a netbook with a single command.

But really, I don't know. Tom is working on various bits and bobs and
I'm not going to double-guess what will happen -- there's no point
talking about stuff which may not work out. I must leave it to Tom to
announce his work :-)

&gt;<i> A good start for this is:  <A HREF="http://wiki.osdev.org/FAT,">http://wiki.osdev.org/FAT,</A> but further
</I>&gt;<i> investigation work would be needed I would imagine before you could enhance

</I>
Although I've not looked at it in any depth, I think FAT16 will be
easier to implement as you have a full word (2 bytes) for dealing with
clusters on the disk. When I was writing the FAT12 write code for
MikeOS, the trickiest part was dealing with 12-bit cluster entries --
that is, a byte-and-a-half each time, requiring lots of shifting and
masking to get it right!

Of course, along with FAT16 would be hard drive booting, but that's
another step. Nonetheless, I see FAT16 as a modification that could be
done in the current code without any massive, sweeping changes.

&gt;<i> We're looking at FAT support at the moment here in ApolloOS (for the release
</I>&gt;<i> after next), so I'll be interested to see how this pans out...
</I>
Good luck -- I imagine there'll be some sample code available as
you're working with C; hopefully that'll help! I couldn't find any
well-documented FAT12 file-writing asm code, hence why I had to sit
down with a spec PDF and write the whole kaboodle from scratch. What
fun :-)
