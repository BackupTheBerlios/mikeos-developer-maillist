Good plan; that should make it clear to developers what they can and can't use.

</I>
That'd definitely cover the current system calls, although as more are
added, we'd have to be careful to avoid the need to squeeze RAM from
before that point. So knocking that up to 4K might be safer.

In summary, this leaves us with:

- 20K for the kernel
- 4K for system call RAM
- 8K for the disk buffer
- 32K for external programs

System calls can define the memory they use in sysvars.asm. This setup
makes system calls more resilient as Ian explained, although it does
add a small bit of complexity to the design and code structure.

What do others on the list reckon? Should we go for maximum
simplicity, or add these extras to stop errant system calls from
trashing the RAM? Would this proposed setup be easy to understand for
those new to the MikeOS design?

All musings welcome!
