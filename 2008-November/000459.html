<PRE>Hi all,

As you know, my goal with MikeOS has been simplicity: making the code
easy to understand, and having lots of detailed documentation.
Recently we've been talking about some major changes for MikeOS 3,
such as unreal mode.

At the same time, Tomasz has done some excellent work with the mouse
driver and has been coding away on new MikeOS features. There's a lot
of cool stuff in development. However, this moves us further away from
the original goal of MikeOS.

So Tomasz and I have agreed to fork MikeOS into another project:
TomOS! We think this will be the best way to keep development active,
and each project will have its own focus:

# MikeOS will be a small, simple operating system that runs in a
single 64K kernel segment and focuses on code clarity and
documentation for aspiring OS developers

# TomOS will be less restrained and explore new features and code --
like a 'super MikeOS' if you will :-)

So these sister projects will share code and ideas where relevant, and
I'm looking forward to helping out with TomOS. When he has a first
release ready, Tomasz will make an announcement on this list pointing
to a new website (and maybe he'll have a mailing list too).

Meanwhile, I've started work on MikeOS 3; I'll post a development
snapshot tonight. I've chopped out some features that I think add too
much complexity to MikeOS, and I've rearranged the source code tree to
make it simpler. Additionally, I've made some improvements to the user
interface, such as a better looking list box:

<A HREF="http://mikeos.berlios.de/3.png">http://mikeos.berlios.de/3.png</A> (compare to the older
<A HREF="http://mikeos.berlios.de/images/shot-1.png">http://mikeos.berlios.de/images/shot-1.png</A>)

MikeOS will always be home to new system calls and certain features,
but anything bigger or that substantially changes the OS will be
better off in TomOS. For MikeOS 3 I especially want to focus on really
good documentation for application programmers, so that we get more
useful programs.

When I post 2.9.1 tonight I'll detail the changes and set up a list of
jobs in case any mailing list lurkers fancy taking on a mini project
:<i>-)
</I>
If anyone has any questions, fire away!

Cheers,
Mike
