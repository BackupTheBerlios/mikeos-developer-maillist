<PRE>&gt;<i> I think Bob's brain had context switched for a second -- there wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> a Paul at the meeting he mentioned. There was another guy from SA
</I>&gt;<i> though so I think that's where the mixup came from :-)
</I>

Yep that would sum it up pretty well...! I've just come back from a long
shift from my part-time job, so you have to make allowances... :-)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, DOS compatibility will no doubt continue with TomOS, the
</I>&gt;<i> feature-laden spin-off of MikeOS. I've heard from Tom and he hopes to
</I>&gt;<i> get a release out in the new year, and he's working on some cool
</I>&gt;<i> stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I will be very interested to see what TomOS will become. Is there any news
you could *exclusively* reveal on this mailing list? (or are you sworn to
secrecy as this will finally be the ultimate Windows-beater we've all been
looking for... lol)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I would really like to see is FAT16 support for MikeOS, although I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand the extra complexity it would add.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That'd be fantastic. I think it's an enhancement that could be
</I>&gt;<i> introduced into the current FAT12 code without any drastic changes to
</I>&gt;<i> the OS design, so if anyone wants to write it that'd be great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A good start for this is:  <A HREF="http://wiki.osdev.org/FAT,">http://wiki.osdev.org/FAT,</A> but further
investigation work would be needed I would imagine before you could enhance
the existing code to work with it.

We're looking at FAT support at the moment here in ApolloOS (for the release
after next), so I'll be interested to see how this pans out...
