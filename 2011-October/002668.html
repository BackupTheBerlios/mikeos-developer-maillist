<PRE>Hi all,

UEFI is already here and at work we have been
using boards that have both traditional BIOS
and UEFI for the past 2 years in assorted projects.
Most new Intel mobos have BIOS and UEFI
as a standard.

The way I read it is that for at least a while, PCs
will come out with BIOS and UEFI and the user
can simply select which one it should boot from.
For backward compatibility reasons, when ever
BIOS boot is enabled, the PC will always start
in RM16.

Quote from <A HREF="http://www.uefi.org/about/">http://www.uefi.org/about/</A>
&quot;Does UEFI completely replace a PC BIOS?

No. While UEFI uses a different interface for
&quot;boot services&quot; and &quot;runtime services&quot;,
some platform firmware must perform the functions
BIOS uses for system configuration
(a.k.a. &quot;Power On Self Test&quot; or &quot;POST&quot;) and Setup.
UEFI does not specify how POST &amp; Setup are implemented.&quot;

UEFI also allows the OS to rely on EFI for
basic graphics and network functions until
OS specific drivers are loaded.

EFI provides a shell environment and this shell can be used
to execute other EFI applications.
See <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface</A>

So it's not all doom and gloom as UEFI does
have support for disk access, basic video drivers
and HID support (keyboard and mouse).
Furthermore, the native UEFI format is 32 bit PE
which is very similar to the Windows DLL format.

For more info on writing/compiling UEFI code:
<A HREF="http://wiki.osdev.org/UEFI">http://wiki.osdev.org/UEFI</A>

Another advantage of (U)EFI is the ability to specify
which device &quot;apps&quot; should be run from without
the need of bootloaders such as GRUB and the like.

Yes, if someone wants to do something really
fancy, some &quot;drivers&quot; will be required which
could be unique to a mobo or family of mobos
but I suspect that once UEFI becomes more
mainstream, manufacturers themselves will
publish some and since the format is PE,
it will be relatively easy to interface to them.
Although it could get messy, the situation
will be similar to that of Windows users
having to get certain drivers
if they want more than the basic resolution
for say a video card.
Any software that then wants to write or
read to the video card would then go via
the API of that driver.

So perhaps the question should be, when
will we see/start a MikeOS UEFI port?

Paulo.
