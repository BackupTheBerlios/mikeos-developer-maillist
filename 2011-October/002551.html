<PRE>Mike,

Another update:

This is what I have found/done to try and make
an image:

I first got a 2GB USB key and formatted it to FAT16.
I left the BPB to correspond to the format and loaded
the bootloader and then copied the kernel across.
Works perfectly as I mentioned previously.

Then I put it in a DOS machine, deleted the single
big partition and made another smaller partition of 16MB.
The rest of the space I left as un-formatted.

Now I transfer the FreeDOS bootloader into the MBR
but keep the original BPB.
I set the partition as DOS &lt;32MB and bootable.

Guess what? It don't work.

I think I have found why (and Mike Gonta please correct
me if I'm wrong).

There seems to be two &quot;standards&quot; as far as the MBR goes.
The one has a partition table located at 1BEh.
It can support up to 4 partitions and each entry is 16 bytes.
The other &quot;standard&quot; does not have the partition tables
and in fact has bootloader code at these offsets.

The bootloader I am using has code at these locations
and hence I cannot have partition tables there hence the
reason why making another smaller partition does not work.

It stands to reason that if partitions exist, there must be a table
somewhere &quot;describing&quot; them.

The strange thing is that Windows can see the partition and
the files in both situations.
PartitionTable Inspector from Norton also sees everything.

This I suspect is the last hurdle to overcome in making a
small image that works.

Googling around, I just found several sites with conflicting
and at times, plain incorrect information.

Any pointers anyone?

As a side note, there have been two good things to come
out of my experiments thus far:

1) You can run DRDOS completely off a USB stick.

2) I now have USB key &quot;support&quot; for DOS by changing
   the MBR of the formatted USB key to make it a &quot;HDD&quot;
   and set it as the second hard-drive.
   Makes transferring files to and from a DOS only box
   and Win/Linux a breeze.

Of course BIOS has to be compatible, but these days,
are large majority are.


Paulo.
