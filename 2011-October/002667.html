Yes, the situation doesn't look rosy. There might be some sort of UEFI
module that can emulate a 16-bit real mode BIOS, but if people have to
obtain and install it, things could get tricky.

I've thought a lot about this, and one of the ideas is the following:

1) Focus on MikeBASIC as the single way to make applications for
MikeOS. The interpreter is portable to any future re-write of MikeOS
we might produce one day.

2) Move all hardware access instructions (ints, ports) into
source/features/hardware.asm as tiny routines such as &quot;hw_print_char&quot;
etc.

3) At some point, rewrite the kernel in 32-bit protected mode asm,
booted by GRUB. The big problem here would be the hardware drivers,
but if all hardware access is performed in
source/features/hardware.asm, we can slowly sort that out by nabbing
code from other BSD/PD projects and dropping it in there.

Ultimately, without the BIOS we'd have some ugly and complex driver
code for the keyboard, screen and disks, and it'd probably have to be
USB so it'd get even more complex. This sort of code would be
completely out of place in a learning project. BUT, if we put all that
in hardware.asm, at least we can attempt to maintain our traditional
simplicit and clarity in the rest of the code, and just make
hardware.asm as &quot;experts only&quot;.
