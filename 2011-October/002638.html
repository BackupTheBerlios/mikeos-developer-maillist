<PRE>Righto, some feedback here:

&gt;<i> LEN COMMAND: &#160;Gets length of a string.
</I>
Good idea, and mostly well done. There's some strange stuff in the code though:

--- CODE ---
        mov word [.num1], ax
        jmp .nexttoken

.nexttoken:
        call get_token
        cmp ax, QUOTE
        je .nexttoken
--- END CODE ---

You don't need that first &quot;jmp&quot; as it's going on to the next line
anyway. Then you seem to be checking for more quoted strings, but the
instruction only returns the length of the FIRST string, so there's no
reason to check for more. The instruction just takes a string and a
var -- nothing else should be processed (or the supplying program is
broken).

Also, I can't see the need to ever perform LEN on a literal quote
string (as the programmer will be explicitly typing it in), so I've
made it just deal with variables.

&gt;<i> DEL COMMAND: Deletes a file off disk
</I>
Cool idea too, and well done. Only thing I'd say is: you chose
different behaviour to the other file commands (eg LOAD and SAVE have
always returned 0 on success, whereas you made DELETE return 1 on
success, which is inconsistent). I've changed this to match the other
commands: result is returned in R, and is 0 for success, 1 for fail or
2 if missing.

Maybe one day we can be more flexible with variables used for file
results, but for now I'd like all file commands to work in the same
way.

SAVE check for a file existing is useful too!

One thing for when you're adding more features: please be consistent
with naming in the code. For instance, you added a command called
&quot;DELETE&quot; but the label for the string was &quot;del_cmd&quot; (should be
&quot;delete_cmd&quot;) and the label for the code was &quot;do_deletefile&quot; (should
be &quot;do_delete&quot;). Minor cosmetic points, but as a teaching OS where we
want people to fully understand and learn from the code, I like to be
very precise with these things :-)

In general they're valuable additions, so thanks Justin, and I'm
looking forward to seeing more contributions! Working on beta 4 now...
