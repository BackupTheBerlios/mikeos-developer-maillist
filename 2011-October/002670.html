<PRE>In PM32, it isn't exactly terrible. I had been messing around with it
lately.

Pluses:
    You can map the memory to one &quot;segment&quot; of 4GB. Lots to play with.
    Displaying video is just writing to video memory (0xB8000)

While this would not exactly be a &quot;dive right in newbie project&quot;, we could
create the framework (BASIC interpreted app development) for someone to get
their feet wet in. I currently have a rudimentary kernel developed in C
(that boots from GRUB) that does the following things:

  - Sets up protected mode
  - Enables A20
  - Loads a GDT, IDT, and sets up thek ayboard as an interrupt service
routine on IRQ1
  - Maps out 4GB of RAM as one large sgement
  - Remaps PIC to function as a system timer
  - has basic &quot;putch, and puts&quot; functions, as well as accepts keyboard input
(have to make the keyboard driver more robust)

&gt;<i>From a design level, things completely change. One has to develop a keyboard
</I>drive that pushes keyboard packets to some sort of buffer, which dispatches
them to the appropriate process (or single tasked space) from there.

However; things do not seem so bad. The amount of RAM to play with is
somewhat exciting as well. If anyone has interests, I could share what I
have. We could also keep to asm as well (will just amount in more code
overall)
