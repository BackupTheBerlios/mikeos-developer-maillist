<PRE>Hi everyone,

It has taken a while, but finally 4.3 is finished. This is one of the
biggest releases we've ever made, with a huge number of BASIC
improvements. Many thanks to all those who contributed code and helped
to test! Please give this zip file a quick run-through to check it's
all OK -- if there are no problems, I'll make release announcements on
OSDev, Freecode etc. on Sunday. Full changelog below.

Cheers,
Mike
