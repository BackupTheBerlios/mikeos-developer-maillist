<PRE>&gt;<i>I just wondered whether anyone in the developer community would write
</I>&gt;<i>a extender that could make some MikeOS apps use the standard mikeos
</I>&gt;<i>interface but use full protected mode.
</I>That sounds like a lot of wasted time, in protected mode we would have to
write drivers, what's wrong with real mode anyway?

&gt;<i>After all, int 10h &amp; 13h, etc., although I like them, are a little
</I>&gt;<i>restrictive on their own and don't allow for a lot of &quot;special&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;easier&quot; things.
</I>
&gt;<i>Hey, maybe we can implement a couple of functions of int 21h or even
</I>&gt;<i>80h as part of this extender - for extra portability points.
</I>Well, the advantage of 10h and 13h is that they are provided by BIOS and
you don't have to write them yourself.

&gt;<i>Blacklight will never incorporate MikeBASIC (too much of a hassle, plus
</I>&gt;<i>it's MikeOS' big feature and I don't want to stomp all over Mike's
</I>&gt;<i>impressive work)
</I>How about my language, IOPL? I have about 12 commands now.

&gt;<i>It has taken a while, but finally 4.3 is finished.
</I>Excellent, now I mess around with the source again. Good work on the docs.

&gt;<i>Oh, and I had to remove the FILES instruction from BASIC as it was
</I>&gt;<i>behaving strangely
</I>Yea, I had a few problems with that, I would enter the command into my
interactive interpreter environment, then exit and if I typed 'dir' of the
commandline it would freeze, or was it the other way around? Something
fishy is going on here. I'll check it out soon.
