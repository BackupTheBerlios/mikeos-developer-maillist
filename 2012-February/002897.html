<PRE>Not trying to plug too much, but the OS I'm working on, Blacklight OS, 
is going to be relatively source-compatible with MikeOS (different 
function names, but very similar if not the same parameters as their 
MikeOS equivalents) and each program has its own 64k segment. And yes, 
it does actually exist and it does actually work.

To demonstrate the similarities in source compatibility to MikeOS, the 
first program I had running on it was a quick port of a CPUID program I 
wrote for MikeOS. I posted an image of the program running in MikeOS and 
the first working, program-loading version of Blacklight here a while 
ago (<A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/gO6sK.png">http://i.imgur.com/gO6sK.png</A>). At the time of writing, I'm about to 
start testing the writing half of the port of the MikeOS FAT12 driver 
across segments. Reading works perfectly (as evidenced by the shell's 
ability to run programs -- no picture yet, will get one soon).

NOTE: The project is in no way intended to supplant or otherwise 
replace MikeOS. MikeOS has always seemed to be (and I would presume 
always will be) focused on showing how to write an operating system, 
while Blacklight OS is just an OS that has some similarities to MikeOS. 
Blacklight will never incorporate MikeBASIC (too much of a hassle, plus 
it's MikeOS' big feature and I don't want to stomp all over Mike's 
impressive work) and will probably be nowhere near as active as MikeOS 
has been and will be.

If anyone's interested, I'll release an alpha release soon and maybe 
end up setting up a mailing list a la this one.

Anyways, back to the topic (and OS) at hand!
