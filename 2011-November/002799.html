<PRE>Hi folks,

It's here: <A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/mikeos/mikeos-4.3b8.zip">http://prdownload.berlios.de/mikeos/mikeos-4.3b8.zip</A>

Changes since beta 7 are Joshua's latest BASIC updates (including the
new PEEKINT and POKEINT commands). But we're definitely in feature
freeze now, so I'm not looking for anything other than bugfixes.
Please try it out, test the new features, and provide feedback on the
list, so that we can get it released eventually! Full changelog below.

Cheers,
Mike
