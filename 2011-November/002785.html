Thankyou very much, I will definately have to implement this.

&gt;<i> Well, the problem it that this is a potentially infinite loop.
</I>&gt;<i> What if the mouse wasn't producing the right output, what if there was
</I>&gt;<i> no mouse connected?
</I> 
I wasn't worried about that for the moment, I was literally just trying to get it to work - but thanks for the feedback.

&gt;<i> PS I found this mouse driver on the OSDEV forums:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=24277">http://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=24277</A>

I've looked at this code already. The problem was that I didn't want to have a 4th or 5th button (just left click and the ability to move the mouse).
 
The other problem was it wasn't commented out very well and has comments such as 'some compaq voodoo magic to enable irq12' - brilliant for understanding.
 
I'm going to keep searching, although that would do the trick. I have adjusted the code as below and can now get output - but it seems to be arriving in the wrong order?!?!?!?
 
--------------------------------------------
; Mouse Calls #############################################
mouse_start:
   pusha
 
   call mouse_wait
   mov al, 0xA8
   out 0x64, al   ; Intialise mouse
 
   call mouse_wait
   mov al, 0x20   ; Get compaq status byte
   out 0x64, al
 
   call mouse_wait
   in al, 0x60   ; Retrieve compaq status byte
   or al, 2
   xor cx, cx
   mov cl, al
   mov al, 0x60
   out 0x64, al
   mov al, cl
   out 0x60, al
   call mouse_wait

   mov dl, 0xF6   ; Set the mouse into defualt settings
   call mouse_write
   call mouse_read
 
; ## May not be needed below 'chunk', as it is for stream mode only.
   mov dl, 0xF4   ; Enable Data Reporting
   call mouse_write
   call mouse_read
 
   mov dl, 0xF0   ; Enable Mouse (Remote Mode)
   call mouse_write
   call mouse_read
 
   popa
   ret
 
mouse_wait:
   in al, 0x64   ; Read from keyboard controller
   test al, 1   ; Processing data?
   jnz mouse_wait   ; Jump if not able to write
 
   in al, 0x64   ; Read from keyboard controller
   test al, 2   ; Processing data?
   jnz mouse_wait   ; Jump if not able to read
 
   ret
 
; #### Input:       ## Output: DL=Byte ####
mouse_read:
   call mouse_wait
   in al, 0x60
   mov dl, al
 
.done:
   ret
 
; #### Input: DL=Byte(Input)    ## Output:  ####
mouse_write:
   call mouse_wait
   mov al, 0xD4
   out 0x64, al
 
   call mouse_wait
   mov al, dl
   out 0x60, al
 
   ret
 
--------------------------------------
 
I'm requesting the data packet with:
 
----------------------------------------
 
 mov dl, 0xEB
 call mouse_write
 
 call mouse_read   ; Read Acknowledge byte
 
 call mouse_read   ; Read first byte
 mov byte [mouse_byte1], dl
 
 call mouse_read   ; Read second byte
 mov byte [mouse_byte2], dl
 
 call mouse_read   ; Read third byte
 mov byte [mouse_byte3], dl
 
--------------------------------------------------
 
I get a different result dependant on what machine I use - sometimes I am able to see if the mouse is clicking, sometimes not. The mouse also hangs, and then comes back after 10 or so seconds. I also can't seem to get the mouse to read the difference between the X byte, and the Y byte - but it does detect movement.
 
I can't thank you enough for taking the time to reply. It's been a real &quot;pull my hair out&quot; sort of problem. The ridiculous thing is I have been able to do everything else I want perfectly fine, butthis just doesn't appear to work for love nor money.
