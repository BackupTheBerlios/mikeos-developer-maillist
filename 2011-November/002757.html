<PRE>&gt;<i>autorun.asm:42: error: symbol `os_command_line' undefined
</I>&gt;<i>Presumably you've declared that in your own mikedev.inc?
</I>
Yes, it's already an internal call, I just declared it in the
kernel and in &quot;mikedev.inc&quot;, so it would work on external
programs.


&gt;<i>I don't know if this is some sort of trick you're using
</I>
Self modifying code. This is put right after the &quot;goto start&quot;
and &quot;command:&quot;, so that the location of it will not change.
It's at progstart + 20 that the command will be copied to
plus the &quot;return&quot; word and then it GOSUB's to the command section.
It does a lot of other stuff so it will run naturally but that's
the basics.


&gt;<i>There's some &quot;start_iopl&quot; routine in there
</I>
Sorry, just remove that.


&gt;<i>I'm not quite sure what benefit this has vs. putting it at some
</I>&gt;<i>location in memory followed by a return and gosub'ing to it.
</I>
This section cannot be put in the memory, GOSUB's cannot be located
outside the program.


&gt;<i>People's text editors could
</I>&gt;<i>mess up on the NULs in BASIC.BAS and render it unusable.
</I>
Okay, point taken. I'll change them to spaces.


&gt;<i>In fact, it's entirely possible that the MikeOS text editor may do this itself!
</I>
No, it doesn't touch them. If it did we would not be having the conversation.


Never mind about my program by the way, I've fixed it.
I found out the problem by looking through how the kernel loads BASIC programs.
It was undocumented, however very important that the source index points to
the parameters for the program. This means the Interactive Interpreter is being
pointed to some random garbage. It will try to execute parameters as commands
(for the command line mode) causing an &quot;unknown command&quot;.
Zeroing the source index fixed the problem. I've attached the new version of
the boot menu program and my interactive interpreter.
