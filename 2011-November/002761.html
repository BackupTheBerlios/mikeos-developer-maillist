<PRE>Hi folks,

It's here: <A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/mikeos/mikeos-4.3b7.zip">http://prdownload.berlios.de/mikeos/mikeos-4.3b7.zip</A>

Big changes from beta 6 are the BASIC features that Joshua talked
about. Thanks Joshua!

There's a lot of new stuff now, so this will be the final 4.3 beta
release. One week from now, I plan to make a release candidate with
updated documentation, which I'll also leave up for a week. Providing
nothing big comes up, that RC will become the final 4.3 release.

Folks, we need LOTS OF TESTING to get this out of the door. There are
many new features that could do with some hammering, so please help
out if you get the time! Find a new BASIC command or feature below
that intrigues you, write some code to test it with various data, and
let us know if you spot any bugs.

Thanks muchly! Hopefully in two weeks, we'll go live with 4.3 final on
SourceForge.

Mike
