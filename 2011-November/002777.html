<PRE>&gt;<i>Great progress to say the very least.
</I>
Thanks!


&gt;<i>I ran the Calculator&gt; went onto advanced mathematics&gt; pressed down a few times, I could select a blank space in the menu.
</I>
This is a problem with the MB++ library, I uploaded a fix before
reading this, how quick is that?
Menus were really messy in the old MB++ library, but in the new
version (3.0) they are much cleaner, because you cannot select
blank items and we only redraw a single item and not all the spaces,
using a quick method of drawing to.


&gt;<i>I imagine some sort of limit on how far down it goes would be good, and merely bring up the back option so that it is just
</I>&gt;<i>under the other options would do the trick.
</I>
Not a problem with the OS BASIC, a problem with my library, fixed now.


&gt;<i>Animation on all of the programs I have tested seemed 'laggy', but very cool for the the limitations you have set yourselves.
</I>
Sigh, MB++ again. If a string is set to a certain value then animation
are enabled.
They are to make popup boxes look &quot;cooler&quot;, however on anything less
then a Pentium they appear very slow.
I've done all I can to speed them up but, still too slow. The
calculator does have an option to disable it.
This shouldn't be a problem on a computer (not netbook) made in the
last 10 year or so.


&gt;<i>It seemed that in the applications it may not have been worth putting in as it slowed progress down (for example moving
</I>&gt;<i>in between menus [backwards and forwards] to a long time).
</I>
ASCII Artist (DRAW.BAS) and Calculator (CALC.BAS) both use this
library, ASCII Artist is still using the inferior version however.
By default animations are disabled but the first thing they both do is
enable them, because I like animations.
Would you prefer I disable them?

&gt;<i>Sorry for all of the comments about the Calculator program for whoever wrote that
</I>
Yea, that's alright. I like people reporting issues (although
sometimes I'd like some praise :-P   ).
