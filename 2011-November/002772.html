Hello all,
Great progress to say the very least. There appear to be alot more programs now the BASIC is up and running which looks promising.
I noticed that on my machines (Virtual Box, 14 year old Compaq, 3 year old gaming rig, 10 year old laptop, and a few others...)  that when I ran the Calculator&gt; went onto advanced mathematics&gt; pressed down a few times, I could select a blank space in the menu. I imagine others will experience this as well and it may cause problems. Haven't had a chance to look at the Basic code (been a while since writing in basic), but I imagine some sort of limit on how far down it goes would be good, and merely bring up the back option so that it is just under the other options would do the trick.
Animation on all of the programs I have tested seemed 'laggy', but very cool for the the limitations you have set yourselves. It seemed that in the applications it may not have been worth putting in as it slowed progress down (for example moving in between menus [backwards and forwards] to a long time).
Sorry for all of the comments about the Calculator program for whoever wrote that, it's just the one that stuck in my mind (which is a good thing).
Hope to show you my little project soon which may interest some MikeOS programmers...
Thanks for reading,
Dan
