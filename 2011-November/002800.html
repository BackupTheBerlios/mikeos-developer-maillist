Hello,
 
All coming together now.
 
Had some spare time...
 
Problems I've found on all of my machines:-
 
CALC.BAS - Selecting Advanced_Maths&gt;Back - Nothing happens. Can be escaped with the exit button which then leads to a weird menu where everything highlighted is orange.
 
ANIMATE.BAS - Changing the speeds from low to high - I found on that ther was a massive difference in animation speed from the setup speed (extremely fast) and the slower speed below that.
 
MONITOR.BIN - When running the hex, it looks as if it goes straight to the menu. Then I pressed escape in an attept to refresh it and realised I was still in the program? Then I pressed x and enter to escape the program and whole OS crashed. (Loading a blue background, blank grey bar at the top and a grey bar beneath with Version 4.3b8 left of the bar - if that gives any idea as to where the code stopped working).
 
EDIT.BIN - Doesn't allow for the user to make a new file on the menu (F3). You have to open one and then say you want a new one. If you delete all the BAS files and TXT files then the editor would be rendered useless - although it is still capable of making new files? Also is there any way you could make it so that the only files it can't open up is BIN - so that say you wanted to write HTM, ASM, or any other file extension all with the ability to be edited under the text editor - it could be done? Just a suggestion :)
 
Hope this helps,
 
Dan
