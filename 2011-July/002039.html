<PRE>Hi.

&gt;<i> A bit more info please
</I>I'll try to give you as much details as possible now.

&gt;<i> Are you using the stock floppy image from MikeOS 4.1.2?
</I>I had to play around a little, since VBox can't handle .FLP images, so I downloaded a bootable Windows 95 floppy image (.IMG format) and formatted it, afterwards I wrote bootloader.bin into the floppy image's first sector and copied all the other .bin, .bas and .pcx files from \programs to the floppy's root directory.
I know I did it very complicated but I don't think this was the cause.

&gt;<i> Which BASIC file -- presumably EXAMPLE.BAS?
</I>Yes. But i don't think it depends on which file I open in the Editor - the examble.bas BASIC file was the only I had on my floppy image.

&gt;<i> What exact version of VirtualBox?
</I>Oracle VirtualBox 4.0.8 r71778 under Windows 7 HP x86, using an AMD Turion X2 Mobile RM-72 @2x2.1 GHz, 4 GB of base memory (64 MB for the virtual machine) and an ATI Mobility Radeon with 256 MB of video mem (again 64 MB for MikeOS).


I have tried around a bit and I found out that the Editor works normally if I press Escape another time, but all applications I start after this seem to have problems, also, if I start the Viewer (no matter if there were any programs started before) and open the test.pcx file every application I run after has problems too.
To get a view of how it looks like I made a video which shows my VBox and MikeOS configuration and the actual problem: youtube.com/v/xaO5YUw6A1s

Since it seems like the error occures only on at me, I can't get rid of the feeling that it was my fault, I'd better say &quot;sorry&quot; -just for the case :)

Cheers,
Wolfram.
