<PRE>I appreciate the advice. I am skilled in other areas of programming, just wrapping my head around asm is proving intriguing. Perhaps I will stick to my basic ventures for now as contributing goes, and continue to fiddle with another image of mikeos to learn some ASM. 

I will do as suggested and continue with my basic games; which now that I am understanding why I was ready to throw myself under a bus because code that should have worked wasn't, will be a lot easier.

If I compile from my linux environment and use an editor there, it should compile the basic just fine in theory?

If you're a novice then trying to hunt down a picky little bug in a complex piece of software is NOT a good place to start. Many, many people have come to MikeOS with little asm experience, tried to do something big and given up, so I recommend starting small and working your way up. EDIT is one of the most complex bits of code in MikeOS so steer clear until you feel very comfortable with asm.

A good way to learn, however, is to take very simple DOS games that have source code (especially games that compile to .COM executables) and port them to MikeOS. The MikeOS API is very well documented so you don't need to ask lots of questions. Good luck!
